## 🏗️ How It Works

MASS operates on a simple yet powerful principle: multiple agents are assigned the same task and work independently while having access to a shared memory space. This allows them to observe and learn from each other's approaches in real-time. Once the agents have completed their work, they enter a voting phase to democratically select the most effective solution, which is then presented as the final answer.

This collaborative approach ensures that the final output is not just the work of a single agent but a product of collective intelligence, leading to more robust and well-rounded results.
