While I can confirm that the summit is scheduled for August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley, and will feature discussions on agentic AI systems and autonomous AI infrastructure, specific details about individual talks on agent frameworks are not fully available in the public domain at this time.\n\nNotable mentions from online sources and posts on X indicate that the event will include speakers such as Dawn Song from UC Berkeley, as well as representatives from AMD, Oracle, and LinkedIn. There will also be lightning talks and poster presentations, such as one on '#4KAgent' by Zhengzhong Tu. Additionally, topics like human-agent collaboration and the future of agentic AI in enterprise settings are expected to be discussed, as highlighted by posts on X and web information from Berkeley RDI.\n\nHowever, a comprehensive list of all talks specifically focused on agent frameworks is not currently accessible. I recommend checking the official Berkeley RDI website (https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit) or the event's registration page (https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/inactive.php?eventid=842399) for the most up-to-date agenda and speaker lineup.

However, I can share the most relevant details gathered from web sources and posts on X about the event, which is scheduled for August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley, hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence (RDI).\n\nThe summit will feature discussions on agentic AI systems and autonomous AI infrastructure, with some sessions focusing on agent frameworks. Specific highlights include:\n- **Session 2: Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems** (as noted in available agendas):\n  - **Keynote by Ion Stoica** at 10:45 AM, Co-Founder of Databricks & Anyscale, and Professor at UC Berkeley.\n  - **Focus Talks at 11:05 AM** by Matei Zaharia (Co-Founder/CTO of Databricks and Associate Professor at UC Berkeley) and Sherwin Wu (Head of Engineering for OpenAI API at OpenAI).\n- Additional talks and lightning sessions are expected to cover topics like human-agent collaboration and next-gen AI agent architecture, with speakers such as Dawn Song from UC Berkeley, and representatives from AMD, Oracle, and LinkedIn, as mentioned in online posts on X.\n- A lightning talk and poster presentation on '#4KAgent' by Zhengzhong Tu is also scheduled, as shared on X.\n\nSince a full list of talks specifically on agent frameworks is not publicly detailed at this time, I recommend visiting the official Berkeley RDI website (https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit) or the event registration page (https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/inactive.php?eventid=842399) for the latest agenda and speaker lineup. As the summit is tomorrow, real-time updates may also be available on social media platforms like X under hashtags or handles related to Berkeley RDI or Agentic AI Summit. If you need further assistance with accessing live updates or specific talk details during the event, I‚Äôm happy to help.\""

However, based on information gathered from the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence (RDI) website and recent posts on X, I can share the following highlights of relevant sessions and talks scheduled for the summit on August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley:\n\n- **Session 2: Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems**:\n  - **Keynote by Ion Stoica** at 10:45 AM: Co-Founder of Databricks & Anyscale, and Professor at UC Berkeley, likely discussing foundational aspects of agent frameworks.\n  - **Focus Talks at 11:05 AM**:\n    - **Matei Zaharia**, Co-Founder/CTO of Databricks and Associate Professor at UC Berkeley, expected to cover technology stacks for agentic systems.\n    - **Sherwin Wu**, Head of Engineering for OpenAI API at OpenAI, potentially addressing API integrations in agent frameworks.\n- **Additional Relevant Talks**:\n  - A lightning talk and poster presentation on '#4KAgent' by Zhengzhong Tu, as mentioned in posts on X, focusing on recent research in agent systems.\n  - Discussions on human-agent collaboration by speakers like May Habib, CEO and Co-Founder of Writer, as noted in social media updates.\n  - Talks on next-gen AI agent architecture by prominent figures such as Dawn Song from UC Berkeley, alongside representatives from AMD, Oracle, and LinkedIn, as highlighted in online posts.\n- **Other Sessions**: Workshops or panels on autonomous AI infrastructure and agentic systems may also touch on frameworks, though specific titles and speakers are not fully detailed in available sources.\n\nSince the summit is occurring today (August 2, 2025), real-time updates might be available. I recommend checking the official Berkeley RDI website (https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit) or the event registration page (https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/inactive.php?eventid=842399) for the most current agenda. Additionally, following social media platforms like X for posts under hashtags or handles related to Berkeley RDI or Agentic AI Summit could provide live insights into newly announced talks or schedule changes. If you need assistance accessing specific updates or livestream details (e.g., via https://lu.ma/agentic-ai-summit-livestream), I‚Äôm happy to help further.\n\nThis response incorporates the latest information from web sources and social media to provide the most relevant and specific details currently available.\""

Agent2 provides a broad list of potential topics but lacks specificity regarding actual talks, speakers, or confirmation of their inclusion in the summit. Agent3 acknowledges the lack of complete information and provides useful context and sources but does not deliver a definitive list of talks.\n\nGiven the current date (2025-08-01 19:51:47) and the summit occurring on August 2, 2025, it is possible that more detailed and up-to-date information is available.

While Agent 1 and Agent 3 offer specific session details and speaker names, their answers are still incomplete due to the lack of a comprehensive agenda from available sources. Agent 2 provides a generic list of potential topics without specific ties to the summit‚Äôs schedule or speakers.\n\nAgent 3's response is the most thorough among the three, as it includes specific sessions (e.g., Session 2: Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems), named speakers (e.g., Ion Stoica, Matei Zaharia, Sherwin Wu), and additional mentions of lightning talks and topics like human-agent collaboration. It also acknowledges the limitation of not having a full list and provides actionable next steps by directing the user to official resources for updates. However, it still falls short of fully addressing the request for \"all the talks\" due to the unavailability of a complete schedule at this time.\n\nSince the summit is happening on August 2, 2025 (today, based on the provided current time of 2025-08-01 19:52:26, though the search data indicates 2025-08-02), and real-time information might now be accessible, I will provide an improved answer that builds on Agent 3‚Äôs response, incorporating the most up-to-date insights from the web and posts on X, while still noting the limitations.\n\nüí° Providing answer: \"I‚Äôm unable to provide a complete list of all talks on agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025 due to the limited availability of a detailed public agenda at this time.
