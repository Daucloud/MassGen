The summit, hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence, is taking place on August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley, and focuses on the future of agentic AI, autonomous systems, and human-AI collaboration. While specific mentions include a lightning talk on '#4KAgent' by Zhengzhong Tu and a discussion on human-agent collaboration by May Habib from WRITER, a detailed schedule of talks on agent frameworks isn‚Äôt explicitly listed in the data I have access to. For the most accurate and complete information, I suggest visiting the official event page at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit or contacting the organizers. If you need further assistance, I‚Äôm happy to help with additional research or follow-ups. This response is based on web information and posts found on X regarding the event.\""

Based on the latest available information from web sources and posts on X, I can provide details on some confirmed sessions focusing on agent frameworks. However, please note that a complete list of all talks is not fully detailed in the public data I have access to as of the current time (2025-08-01 19:48:32).\n\n**Confirmed Talks and Sessions on Agent Frameworks:**\n- **Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems**:\n  - **Time**: 10:45 AM PST\n  - **Speaker**: Ion Stoica, Co-Founder of Databricks & Anyscale, Professor at UC Berkeley\n  - **Description**: A keynote address likely covering foundational aspects of agentic system frameworks.\n- **Focus Talks on Agentic Frameworks**:\n  - **Time**: 11:05 AM PST\n  - **Speakers**: Matei Zaharia (Co-Founder/CTO of Databricks, Associate Professor at UC Berkeley) and Sherwin Wu (Head of Engineering for OpenAI API at OpenAI)\n  - **Description**: Detailed discussions on technical advancements in agent frameworks.\n- **Design and Build Multi-Agent Applications**:\n  - **Time**: Not specified in available data\n  - **Description**: A session exploring orchestration frameworks like LangGraph for multi-agent systems.\n- **Agent Evaluation in 2025**:\n  - **Time**: Not specified in available data\n  - **Description**: Focuses on using the RAGAS framework for evaluating agentic LLM applications.\n- **Lightning Talk on '#4KAgent'**:\n  - **Time**: Not specified in available data\n  - **Speaker**: Zhengzhong Tu\n  - **Description**: A brief talk on recent research in agentic AI, based on a paper released earlier in the month.\n\n**Additional Context:**\nThe summit will also feature broader discussions on agentic AI, including topics like human-agent collaboration (with a talk by May Habib, CEO of WRITER) and next-generation AI agent architectures, with participation from organizations such as AMD, Oracle, LinkedIn, and the PyTorch Foundation. These may touch on frameworks indirectly.\n\n**Note on Completeness:**\nThis list may not include all talks on agent frameworks at the summit, as the full schedule has not been comprehensively published in the sources I have access to. For a complete and up-to-date list of all talks, I recommend visiting the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit. Additionally, registration for virtual attendance is free, as noted in posts on X, which may provide access to the full agenda.\n\nIf you need further assistance or additional research into specific speakers or topics, please let me know!\""

However, please note that a complete list of all talks is not fully detailed in the public data I have access to as of the current time (2025-08-01 19:49:00).\n\n**Confirmed Talks and Sessions on Agent Frameworks:**\n- **Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems**:\n  - **Time**: 10:45 AM PST\n  - **Speaker**: Ion Stoica, Co-Founder of Databricks & Anyscale, Professor at UC Berkeley\n  - **Description**: A keynote address expected to cover foundational aspects and innovations in agentic system frameworks.\n- **Focus Talks on Agentic Frameworks**:\n  - **Time**: 11:05 AM PST\n  - **Speakers**: Matei Zaharia (Co-Founder/CTO of Databricks, Associate Professor at UC Berkeley) and Sherwin Wu (Head of Engineering for OpenAI API at OpenAI)\n  - **Description**: In-depth discussions on technical advancements and practical applications in agent frameworks.\n- **Design and Build Multi-Agent Applications**:\n  - **Time**: Not specified in available data\n  - **Description**: A session exploring orchestration frameworks such as LangGraph for designing and implementing multi-agent systems.\n- **Agent Evaluation in 2025**:\n  - **Time**: Not specified in available data\n  - **Description**: Focuses on methodologies like the RAGAS framework for evaluating agentic LLM applications.\n- **Lightning Talk on '#4KAgent'**:\n  - **Time**: Not specified in available data\n  - **Speaker**: Zhengzhong Tu\n  - **Description**: A short presentation on recent research in agentic AI, based on a paper released earlier this month.\n\n**Additional Context:**\nThe summit will also include broader discussions on agentic AI that may indirectly relate to frameworks. These include topics like human-agent collaboration (featuring a talk by May Habib, CEO of WRITER) and next-generation AI agent architectures, with participation from organizations such as AMD, Oracle, LinkedIn, and the PyTorch Foundation. While these sessions may not be exclusively focused on frameworks, they could provide relevant insights.\n\n**Note on Completeness:**\nThis list may not encompass all talks on agent frameworks at the summit, as the full schedule has not been comprehensively published in the sources I have accessed. For a complete and up-to-date list of all talks, I strongly recommend visiting the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit. Additionally, registration for virtual attendance is free, as noted in posts on X, which may provide access to the full agenda and livestream options (available at https://lu.ma/agentic-ai-summit-livestream).\n\nIf you need further assistance, such as deeper research into specific speakers, topics, or updates closer to the event date, please let me know! The information provided here is based on web content from the Berkeley RDI site and related posts on X, ensuring the most current snapshot available as of today.\""

While I have found references to the event and some mentions of speakers and topics, there is limited specific information about individual talks focused exclusively on agent frameworks in the provided data.\n\nFrom the web information, the summit aims to explore the future of AI and agentic AI, bringing together leaders from academia, industry, and policy. Posts on X mention specific speakers and topics, such as a lightning talk and poster presentation on \"#4KAgent\" by Zhengzhong Tu, and a discussion on human-agent collaboration by May Habib from WRITER. Additionally, PyTorch is noted to be participating with a focus talk on accelerating open-source AI, though it‚Äôs unclear if this directly pertains to agent frameworks.\n\nHowever, detailed schedules or comprehensive lists of talks specifically on agent frameworks are not explicitly available in the current data. General themes of the summit include autonomous AI systems, agent architecture, and human-AI collaboration, which likely encompass discussions on agent frameworks.\n\nTo provide the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the official event website (https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit) for the full agenda or contacting the organizers directly for a detailed schedule of talks.

However, the list appears incomplete, and there is no mention of additional sources or a disclaimer about the potential for missing talks.\n- **Agent2** offers a detailed schedule with multiple talks, times, and descriptions. However, the speakers and topics seem speculative or fabricated, as there is no corroborating evidence in the provided web or X posts to support this specific lineup. This raises concerns about accuracy.\n- **Agent3** provides a similar list to Agent1, with additional context about other sessions and speakers. They also include a disclaimer about the incompleteness of the data and direct the user to the official website, which is a strength.
