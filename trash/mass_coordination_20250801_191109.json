However, based on available information from the web and posts on X, I can confirm that the summit, hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence, is taking place on August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley. It features discussions on agentic AI systems, autonomous AI infrastructure, and related topics.\n\nNotable mentions include a focus talk by PyTorch on accelerating open-source AI, a lightning talk by Zhengzhong Tu on '#4KAgent,' and a discussion by May Habib from WRITER on human-agent collaboration. While these may touch on agent frameworks, specific talks dedicated solely to agent frameworks are not detailed in the available sources.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend visiting the official Berkeley RDI website or the event page at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit for the full agenda and list of talks. If you have access to the summit‚Äôs program or livestream (available via platforms like Luma), you may be able to identify specific sessions on agent frameworks there.\""

However, I can share what is known based on information from the web and posts on X about the summit, which is hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence and scheduled for August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley.\n\nWhile specific talks exclusively focused on agent frameworks are not detailed in the available information, the summit is described as a deep dive into agentic systems and autonomous AI infrastructure. A few relevant sessions and speakers have been mentioned:\n- A focus talk by PyTorch on how the Linux Foundation and PyTorch Foundation are accelerating open-source AI, which may include discussions relevant to agent frameworks (source: post on X).\n- A lightning talk and poster presentation by Zhengzhong Tu on '#4KAgent,' which could relate to agent framework innovations (source: post on X).\n- A discussion by May Habib, CEO and Co-founder of WRITER, on human-agent collaboration, potentially touching on framework considerations (source: post on X).\n\nGiven the summit's emphasis on agentic AI, it is likely that additional talks or panels will cover agent frameworks, but these are not explicitly listed in the current public data. For a comprehensive list of talks on agent frameworks, I recommend checking the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit or registering for the event or livestream (details available on platforms like Luma) to access the full agenda. If you have any specific speakers or topics in mind, I can help search for more targeted information.\""

However, based on information from the web and posts on X, I can share what is currently known about the summit, which is hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence and taking place on August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe summit is described as a deep dive into agentic systems and autonomous AI infrastructure, suggesting that agent frameworks will be a significant focus. While specific talks exclusively on agent frameworks are not fully detailed in the available information, the following relevant sessions or speakers have been mentioned:\n- A focus talk by PyTorch on how the Linux Foundation and PyTorch Foundation are accelerating open-source AI, which may include discussions relevant to agent frameworks.\n- A lightning talk and poster presentation by Zhengzhong Tu on '#4KAgent,' which could relate to innovations in agent frameworks.\n- A discussion by May Habib, CEO and Co-founder of WRITER, on human-agent collaboration, potentially touching on framework considerations.\n\nGiven the summit's emphasis on agentic AI, it is highly likely that additional talks or panels will cover agent frameworks, but these are not explicitly listed in the current public data. For a comprehensive and up-to-date list of talks on agent frameworks, I recommend visiting the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit or registering for the event (virtual attendance is available and free, as noted in posts on X). You can also check for updates on platforms like Luma for livestream details and the full agenda.\n\nIf you have specific speakers or sub-topics in mind related to agent frameworks, I can help search for more targeted information. The information provided here is based on web sources and social media posts accessed as of the current date, August 2, 2025.\""

However, based on information from the web and posts on X, I can share what is currently known about the summit, which is hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence and taking place on August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe summit is described as a deep dive into agentic systems and autonomous AI infrastructure, indicating that agent frameworks will be a significant focus. While specific talks exclusively on agent frameworks are not fully detailed in the available information, the following relevant sessions or speakers have been mentioned:\n- A focus talk by PyTorch on how the Linux Foundation and PyTorch Foundation are accelerating open-source AI, which may include discussions relevant to agent frameworks.\n- A lightning talk and poster presentation by Zhengzhong Tu on '#4KAgent,' which could relate to innovations in agent frameworks.\n- A discussion by May Habib, CEO and Co-founder of WRITER, on human-agent collaboration, potentially touching on framework considerations.\n\nAdditionally, given the summit's emphasis on agentic AI, it is highly likely that other talks or panels will cover agent frameworks. For instance, broader topics such as designing robust agent architectures, scalability in agent systems, ethical considerations, and real-world applications are expected to be part of the agenda, though specific timings and speakers for these topics are not confirmed in the current data.\n\nFor a comprehensive and up-to-date list of talks on agent frameworks, I recommend visiting the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit or registering for the event (virtual attendance is available and free, as noted in posts on X). You can also check for updates on platforms like Luma for livestream details and the full agenda.\n\nThe information provided here is based on web sources and social media posts accessed as of the current date, August 2, 2025. If you have specific speakers or sub-topics in mind related to agent frameworks, I can help search for more targeted information.\""

However, I can share the following insights based on information from the Berkeley RDI website and relevant posts on X about the summit, which is hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence at UC Berkeley on August 2, 2025.\n\nThe summit is focused on agentic AI and autonomous AI infrastructure, suggesting that agent frameworks will be a central theme in many discussions. While specific talks exclusively titled around agent frameworks are not detailed in the available information, the following sessions or speakers are confirmed to be part of the event and may cover relevant topics:\n- A focus talk by PyTorch representatives on accelerating open-source AI through the Linux Foundation and PyTorch Foundation, which could include discussions on frameworks for agentic AI.\n- A lightning talk and poster presentation by Zhengzhong Tu on '#4KAgent,' a recent paper that may relate to innovations in agent frameworks.\n- A discussion by May Habib, CEO and Co-founder of WRITER, on human-agent collaboration, which might touch on framework design and implementation.\n\nAdditionally, given the summit's emphasis on agentic systems, it is likely that other sessions will address topics such as designing robust agent architectures, scalability in agent systems, ethical considerations, and real-world applications of agent frameworks. However, specific titles, speakers, and timings for these potential talks are not confirmed in the data I have access to.\n\nFor a comprehensive and up-to-date list of talks on agent frameworks, I strongly recommend visiting the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit or registering for the event (noting that virtual attendance is free, as mentioned in posts on X). You can also look for real-time updates on platforms like X or event pages for the latest agenda and livestream details.\n\nThe information provided here is based on web sources and social media posts accessed as of August 2, 2025. If you have specific speakers or sub-topics in mind related to agent frameworks, I can attempt to search for more targeted information or assist further.\""

However, I can share the following information based on data from the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence (RDI) website and relevant posts on social media platforms like X.\n\nThe Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025, hosted by UC Berkeley's Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence on August 2, 2025, focuses on agentic AI and autonomous AI infrastructure. Given this emphasis, it is highly likely that agent frameworks will be a central theme in many of the talks. Below are some confirmed sessions and speakers that may cover topics related to agent frameworks, based on available information:\n\n- **Focus Talk by PyTorch Representatives**: This session will discuss accelerating open-source AI through the Linux Foundation and PyTorch Foundation. While not explicitly titled as an agent framework talk, the context of open-source AI tools could include discussions on frameworks for agentic systems. (Source: Post on X by PyTorch, dated July 31, 2025)\n- **Lightning Talk and Poster Presentation by Zhengzhong Tu**: Zhengzhong Tu will present on '#4KAgent,' a recent paper released in July 2025. This talk may include insights into innovative agent frameworks or architectures. (Source: Post on X by Zhengzhong Tu, dated July 29, 2025)\n- **Discussion by May Habib (CEO and Co-founder of WRITER)**: This session will focus on human-agent collaboration and provide a sneak peek into a product update. It may touch on the design and implementation of agent frameworks in enterprise settings. (Source: Post on X by WRITER, dated July 29, 2025)\n\nAdditionally, broader topics likely to be covered at the summit‚Äîgiven its focus on agentic AI‚Äîmay include designing robust agent architectures, scalability in agent systems, ethical considerations, real-world applications, and future trends in agent technologies. However, specific talk titles, speakers, and timings for these topics are not confirmed in the data I have access to.\n\nFor a definitive and up-to-date list of all talks on agent frameworks, I recommend visiting the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit or registering for the event (noting that virtual attendance is free, as mentioned in social media posts). You can also check for real-time updates on platforms like X or event pages for the latest agenda and livestream details.\n\nIf you have specific sub-topics or speakers in mind related to agent frameworks, I can attempt to search for more targeted information or assist further. The information provided here is based on web sources and social media posts accessed as of August 2, 2025.\""
