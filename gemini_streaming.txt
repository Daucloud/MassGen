TEXT: As of the end of the 2024 MLB season, and including statistics from the Negro Leagues which were officially recognized by Major League Baseball in 2020, there have been a total of **58 unique players** who have won a Triple Crown.

This total is broken down into two categories:

*   **Batting Triple Crown Winners:** 23 unique players have achieved the batting Triple Crown, leading their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in a single season. Notable winners include Miguel Cabrera (2012), Ted Williams (twice), Rogers Hornsby (twice), and Oscar Charleston (three times, in the Negro Leagues).
*   **Pitching Triple Crown Winners:** 35 unique pitchers have accomplished the pitching Triple Crown, leading their league in wins, earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts. The most recent winners were Chris Sale and Tarik Skubal, both in 2024. This list includes historical figures like Walter Johnson (three times) and Sandy Koufax (three times), as well as Negro League pitchers.

No player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. Therefore, the total number of unique individuals who have earned this prestigious honor is the sum of the unique batting and pitching winners.

TEXT: The current answers provided by the agents are inconsistent and do not fully reflect the most up-to-date and comprehensive Major League Baseball (MLB) historical records, especially regarding the inclusion of Negro League statistics.

Here's a breakdown based on current MLB official historical records, which since 2020, include statistics from the Negro Leagues (1920-1948):

**1. Batting Triple Crown Winners:**
A batting Triple Crown is achieved when a player leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in a single season.
*   As of the end of the 2023 MLB season, there have been **28 instances** of a player winning the batting Triple Crown across all leagues now recognized as Major Leagues.
*   These 28 instances were achieved by **23 unique players**.
    *   Oscar Charleston won it 3 times.
    *   Rogers Hornsby, Josh Gibson, and Ted Williams each won it 2 times.
    *   The remaining 19 players each won it once.
*   The most recent player to achieve the batting Triple Crown was **Miguel Cabrera** of the Detroit Tigers in 2012.

**2. Pitching Triple Crown Winners:**
A pitching Triple Crown is achieved when a pitcher leads their league in wins, earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts in a single season.
*   As of the end of the 2023 MLB season, there have been **45 instances** of a pitcher winning the Triple Crown across all leagues now recognized as Major Leagues.
*   These 45 instances were achieved by **35 unique pitchers**.
    *   Walter Johnson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Sandy Koufax each won it 3 times.
    *   Christy Mathewson, Lefty Grove, Lefty Gomez, and Roger Clemens each won it 2 times.
    *   The remaining 28 pitchers each won it once.
*   The most recent pitcher to achieve the Triple Crown was **Shane Bieber** of the Cleveland Guardians in 2020. Claims about 2024 winners are speculative as the season has not concluded and official recognition has not been made.

**Total Triple Crown Winners in MLB History (Batting + Pitching):**
Combining both categories, there have been a total of **73 instances** of a Triple Crown winner in Major League Baseball history (28 batting + 45 pitching instances).

Therefore, the most accurate and complete answer to "How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?" is 73 instances.

Final Answer: There have been a total of 73 Triple Crown winners in Major League Baseball history. This total includes 28 instances of a batting Triple Crown and 45 instances of a pitching Triple Crown, encompassing statistics from both the American and National Leagues, as well as the Negro Leagues, which MLB officially recognized as Major Leagues in 2020. The most recent batting Triple Crown was achieved by Miguel Cabrera in 2012, and the most recent pitching Triple Crown was achieved by Shane Bieber in 2020.

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: In Major League Baseball (MLB), a Triple Crown is one of the most elite accomplishments, achieved by leading a league in three key statistical categories in a single season. As of the end of the 2024 season, there have been a total of 63 Triple Crown winners across both categories:\n\n- **Batting Triple Crown Winners**: 22 instances, where players led their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs). Notable winners include Ty Cobb (1909), Rogers Hornsby (1922 and 1925), Lou Gehrig (1934), Ted Williams (1942 and 1947), and Miguel Cabrera (2012, the most recent).\n\n- **Pitching Triple Crown Winners**: 41 instances, where pitchers led their league in wins, earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts. Recent winners include Chris Sale (Atlanta Braves, 2024) and Tarik Skubal (Detroit Tigers, 2024), with earlier examples like Grover Cleveland Alexander (1915) and Roger Clemens (1997 and 1998).\n\nThis total is based on official MLB records and historical data from sources like Baseball-Reference.com and Wikipedia. The Triple Crown underscores extraordinary dominance and has become increasingly rare in modern baseball.\n\n**Agent 2**: In Major League Baseball (MLB), a Triple Crown is a prestigious achievement awarded to a player who leads their league in three specific statistical categories during a single season. There are two types of Triple Crowns:\n\n1.  **Batting Triple Crown:** Leading the league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n2.  **Pitching Triple Crown:** Leading the league in wins, earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts.\n\nAs of the end of the 2024 MLB season, and incorporating official MLB records which now include statistics from the Negro Leagues:\n\n*   There have been **28 instances** of a player winning the Batting Triple Crown. This feat has been achieved by 23 unique players, with some players winning it multiple times. The most recent player to achieve the batting Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers in 2012.\n\n*   There have been **45 instances** of a pitcher winning the Pitching Triple Crown. This accomplishment has been achieved by 35 unique pitchers. The most recent pitcher to achieve the pitching Triple Crown was Shane Bieber of the Cleveland Guardians in 2020. **There were no new Triple Crown winners (batting or pitching) in the 2024 MLB season.**\n\nCombining both categories, there have been a total of **73 Triple Crown winners (instances)** in MLB history.\n\n**Agent 3**: In Major League Baseball (MLB), the Triple Crown is a prestigious achievement awarded to players who lead their league in three key statistical categories during a single season. For batters, this means leading in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs). For pitchers, it involves leading in earned run average (ERA), wins, and strikeouts.\n\n**Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\n\nSince the inception of MLB, 17 players have secured the batting Triple Crown. Notably, Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers was the most recent to accomplish this feat in 2012, marking the first occurrence since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.\n\n**Pitching Triple Crown Winners:**\n\nThe pitching Triple Crown has been achieved more frequently, with 39 instances recorded in MLB history. The most recent occurrences were in 2024, when Chris Sale of the Atlanta Braves and Tarik Skubal of the Detroit Tigers each led their respective leagues in ERA, wins, and strikeouts.\n\nThese accomplishments underscore the exceptional talent and versatility required to dominate multiple statistical categories within a single season.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n\n\nNote that the `new_answer` and `vote` tools are not enabled now.
