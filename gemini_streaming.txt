TEXT: In Major League Baseball (MLB), the "Triple Crown" typically refers to a batter leading their league in three key statistical categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI).

There have been **16 distinct players** who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown in the American League (AL) or National League (NL) since 1878:

1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, NL)
2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, AA - American Association, considered a major league at the time)
3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, NL)
4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, AL)
5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, AL)
6.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, NL)
7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, NL; 1925, NL) - *Won twice*
8.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, AL)
9.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, NL)
10. **Lou Gehrig** (1934, AL)
11. **Joe Medwick** (1937, NL)
12. **Ted Williams** (1942, AL; 1947, AL) - *Won twice*
13. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, AL)
14. **Frank Robinson** (1966, AL)
15. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, AL)
16. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, AL)

While the question generally refers to the batting Triple Crown, it's also worth noting that a "pitching Triple Crown" exists, achieved by a pitcher leading their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA) in a single season. Several pitchers have also achieved this feat, including Tommy Bond (1877), Christy Mathewson (twice), Lefty Grove (twice), Lefty Gomez (twice), and Roger Clemens (twice), among others.

Additionally, some historical records include Triple Crown winners from the Negro Leagues, which are now recognized as major leagues.

TEXT: There have been **23 unique players** who have won the batting Triple Crown in Major League Baseball history. This prestigious achievement is awarded to a player who leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in a single season.

This count includes:
*   **Players from the American League (AL), National League (NL), and American Association (AA)**: This group includes 15 unique players who achieved the Triple Crown a total of 18 times. Notable winners include Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby (twice), Ted Williams (twice), Mickey Mantle, and Miguel Cabrera (the most recent in 2012).
*   **Players from the Negro Leagues**: Following MLB's official incorporation of Negro Leagues records in 2020, 8 additional unique players were recognized for winning the Triple Crown in those leagues, achieving it a total of 10 times. Legendary players like Oscar Charleston (three times) and Josh Gibson (twice) are among them.

In total, these 23 players have combined for **28 Triple Crown achievements** across all recognized major leagues.

The rarity of this feat underscores its difficulty, especially in the modern era of specialized player roles.
