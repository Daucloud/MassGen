Here's a brief comparison of the main types based on general knowledge up to 2025:\n\n1. **Solar Energy**: Uses photovoltaic panels or thermal systems to convert sunlight into electricity. Pros: Abundant, scalable for homes; Cons: Dependent on weather and location, high initial costs (though decreasing). Efficiency: 15-20% for panels. Environmental impact: Low, but requires rare materials for production.\n\n2. **Wind Energy**: Harnesses wind with turbines to generate electricity. Pros: Cost-effective once installed, high energy output; Cons: Intermittent, noisy, and can harm wildlife. Efficiency: 35-45% (capacity factor). Environmental impact: Minimal, but needs large land areas.\n\n3. **Hydroelectric Energy**: Dams or run-of-river systems convert water flow into electricity. Pros: Reliable and storable; Cons: Disrupts ecosystems and requires specific geography. Efficiency: 90%+. Environmental impact: High due to habitat loss and methane emissions from reservoirs.\n\n4. **Geothermal Energy**: Taps into Earth's heat for power. Pros: Consistent and low-emission; Cons: Limited to geologically active areas, high upfront drilling costs. Efficiency: 10-20% for electricity generation. Environmental impact: Low, but risks include induced seismicity.\n\n5. **Biomass Energy**: Burns organic materials like plants or waste for energy. Pros: Utilizes waste, can be carbon-neutral; Cons: Can compete with food production and emit pollutants. Efficiency: 20-30%. Environmental impact: Variable, often involves deforestation if not managed sustainably.\n\nOverall, the best approach depends on location, resources, and goals. For example, solar and wind are ideal for diverse climates, while hydroelectric suits regions with rivers. Advances by 2025, like better storage (e.g., batteries), have made renewables more competitive against fossil fuels.\""

Here's a brief comparison of the main types based on general knowledge up to 2025:\n\n1. **Solar Energy**: Uses photovoltaic panels or thermal systems to convert sunlight into electricity. Pros: Abundant, scalable for homes; Cons: Dependent on weather and location, high initial costs (though decreasing). Efficiency: 15-20% for panels. Environmental impact: Low, but requires rare materials for production.\n\n2. **Wind Energy**: Harnesses wind with turbines to generate electricity. Pros: Cost-effective once installed, high energy output; Cons: Intermittent, noisy, and can harm wildlife. Efficiency: 35-45% (capacity factor). Environmental impact: Minimal, but needs large land areas.\n\n3. **Hydroelectric Energy**: Dams or run-of-river systems convert water flow into electricity. Pros: Reliable and storable; Cons: Disrupts ecosystems and requires specific geography. Efficiency: 90%+. Environmental impact: High due to habitat loss and methane emissions from reservoirs.\n\n4. **Geothermal Energy**: Taps into Earth's heat for power. Pros: Consistent and low-emission; Cons: Limited to geologically active areas, high upfront drilling costs. Efficiency: 10-20% for electricity generation. Environmental impact: Low, but risks include induced seismicity.\n\n5. **Biomass Energy**: Burns organic materials like plants or waste for energy. Pros: Utilizes waste, can be carbon-neutral; Cons: Can compete with food production and emit pollutants. Efficiency: 20-30%. Environmental impact: Variable, often involves deforestation if not managed sustainably.\n\nOverall, the best approach depends on location, resources, and goals. For example, solar and wind are ideal for diverse climates, while hydroelectric suits regions with rivers. Advances by 2025, like better storage (e.g., batteries), have made renewables more competitive against fossil fuels.\n\n---\n*Coordinated by 3 agents via MassGen framework*",
