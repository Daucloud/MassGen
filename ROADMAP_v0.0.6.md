- [ ] Implement conversation templates and presets
- [ ] Add conversation search and filtering
- [ ] Create conversation export formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML)
- [ ] Improve multi-turn conversation display formatting
- [ ] Add real-time progress indicators for long-running tasks

#### 3.2 Developer Experience & Tools
- [ ] Add comprehensive debugging and logging options
- [ ] Implement configuration validation and suggestions
- [ ] Add performance profiling and optimization tools
- [ ] Create interactive setup and configuration wizard
- [ ] Implement configurable output verbosity levels
- [ ] Provide fluid `pip install` developer experience

#### 3.3 Production & Extensibility
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create plugin architecture for custom agents and tools
- [ ] Add webhook and API integration capabilities
- [ ] Implement configuration management for different environments
- [ ] Create deployment guides and production best practices

## Key Technical Priorities

### Functional Requirements (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] All backends work reliably with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Backend switching and fallback mechanisms function correctly
- [ ] Conversation save/load and export features work seamlessly

### Performance Requirements (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Coding agents maintain <2s response times
- [ ] Memory usage remains efficient for coding workflows

### Performance Requirements (OPTIONAL)  
- [ ] Backend health checks complete in <500ms
- [ ] Configuration validation completes instantly

### Quality Requirements (REQUIRED)
- [x] ~~95%+ test coverage for coding agent features~~ (Completed: Test infrastructure for Claude Code integration)
- [x] ~~Zero regressions in existing multi-turn and coordination behavior~~ (Completed: All existing functionality preserved)
- [x] ~~Comprehensive documentation for coding agent setup and usage~~ (Completed: Backend documentation updates, architecture docs)

### Quality Requirements (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation with production deployment guides
- [ ] User-friendly error messages and configuration validation

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Existing Backends**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and Grok backend foundation
- **Multi-Turn Architecture**: Current conversation context system
- **Configuration System**: YAML/JSON configuration management
- **Test Infrastructure**: Existing comprehensive test suite

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **Backend Reliability**: *Mitigation*: Comprehensive error handling and health monitoring
2. **Coding Agent Integration Complexity**: *Mitigation*: Dedicated testing and validation frameworks
3. **Configuration Complexity**: *Mitigation*: Validation tools and interactive setup wizard
4. **Backward Compatibility**: *Mitigation*: Extensive regression testing
5. **Production Deployment**: *Mitigation*: Clear deployment guides and monitoring tools

## Post-v0.0.6 Considerations

### Future Enhancements (v0.0.6+)
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based conversation interface
- **API Server**: RESTful API for third-party integrations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conversation insights and optimization suggestions
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Image and file handling in conversations

### Long-term Vision
