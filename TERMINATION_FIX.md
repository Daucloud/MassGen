# Process Termination Fix

## Problem Description

The MASS system was experiencing a process hanging issue where the program would complete successfully (showing "WORKFLOW COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY" in logs) but the process would not terminate, requiring manual intervention (Ctrl+C).

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by HTTP clients and background resources maintained by the AI agent implementations:

1. **OpenAI agents** created `OpenAI()` clients with persistent HTTP sessions
2. **Grok agents** created `Client()` instances with background threads  
3. **Gemini agents** used `requests.post()` with potential connection pooling
4. These resources were never explicitly cleaned up when the workflow completed

Even though the workflow logic finished successfully, background threads and HTTP connections prevented the Python process from terminating.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Agent Cleanup Methods

Added `cleanup()` methods to all agent classes:

```python
def cleanup(self):
    """Clean up HTTP client resources."""
    if self._client:
        try:
            self._client.close()
        except Exception:
            pass  # Ignore cleanup errors
        self._client = None
```

### 2. System-Wide Cleanup

Added `cleanup_agents()` method to `MassSystem` class that calls cleanup on all agents:

```python
def cleanup_agents(self):
    """Clean up all agent resources to prevent hanging processes."""
    if hasattr(self, 'agents') and self.agents:
        for agent in self.agents:
            if hasattr(agent, 'cleanup'):
                agent.cleanup()
```

### 3. Automatic Cleanup Integration

- Cleanup is automatically called at the end of both `run_task()` and `run_task_from_file()` methods
- Cleanup happens before logging cleanup to ensure proper resource management

### 4. Signal Handlers and Force Exit

Added robust exit mechanisms:

```python
# Signal handlers for graceful cleanup on interruption
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, _signal_handler)
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, _signal_handler)

# Force exit mechanism in main()
try:
    sys.exit(exit_code)
finally:
    # Last resort: force process termination
    os._exit(exit_code)
```

### 5. Global Cleanup Registration

- `atexit` handler ensures cleanup even on unexpected termination
- Global reference allows cleanup from signal handlers

## Testing the Fix

Run the test script to verify the fix works:

```bash
python3 test_termination_fix.py
```

This script tests:
- Basic system initialization and cleanup
- Agent resource cleanup
- Force exit mechanisms

## Usage

No changes are required for existing usage. The cleanup happens automatically:

```bash
# This should now terminate properly after completion
python3 mass_main.py --task-file task.json --agents openai,gemini,grok
```

## Verification

After running a MASS workflow, you should see:

1. Normal workflow completion logs
2. Cleanup messages: `"Cleaning up agent resources..."`
3. Process termination without hanging

If the process still hangs, the force exit mechanism (`os._exit()`) will ensure termination.

## Benefits

- ✅ Processes terminate properly after workflow completion
- ✅ No manual intervention required (no more Ctrl+C)
- ✅ Backward compatible - no API changes
- ✅ Robust signal handling for interruptions
- ✅ Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks in long-running applications
