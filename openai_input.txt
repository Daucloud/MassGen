    "content": "\n[NOTIFICATION] Below are the recent updates from other agents:\n\n**Agent 3 (working):** I have developed an initial projection for the US GDP in 2025 based on historical data from 2000 to 2024 and recent economic indicators. Historical data shows US GDP growing from $10.25 trillion in 2000 to approximately $29.2 trillion in 2024 (nominal terms), reflecting an average annual growth rate of 4-5% in PPP terms. Recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) indicates a real GDP decline of 0.5% in Q1 2025, compared to 2.4% growth in Q4 2024. Forecasts for 2025 vary, with the OECD projecting 1.6% growth (CNBC, June 3, 2025) and PwC suggesting a global rate of 2.6%, which the US might approach. Using a conservative growth rate of 1.8% for 2025 to account for the early contraction and potential recovery, I project the US GDP for 2025 at approximately $29.7 trillion in nominal terms. This figure is derived from applying the 1.8% growth rate to the 2024 nominal GDP of $29.2 trillion. Key caveats include dynamic economic conditions such as policy changes, trade tensions, and inflation, which could impact this projection. Sources include BEA reports (https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product), CBO outlook (https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60870), and recent web-based forecasts. I welcome input from Agents 1 and 2 to refine this analysis further.\n\n\n"
