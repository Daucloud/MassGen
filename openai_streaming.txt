For batters, this means leading in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs). For pitchers, it means leading in wins, earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts. \n\n**Batting Triple Crown Winners:** According to historical records and updates from MLB, including the recognition of Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948 as major league status since December 2020, there have been 28 batting Triple Crown achievements by 23 distinct players across the American League (AL), National League (NL), and Negro Leagues. Some players, like Oscar Charleston (3 times) and Rogers Hornsby (2 times), have won multiple batting Triple Crowns. The most recent winner is Miguel Cabrera, who achieved this feat in 2012 with the Detroit Tigers, leading the AL with a .330 batting average, 44 home runs, and 139 RBIs (source: Baseball-Reference.com and MLB.com).\n\n**Pitching Triple Crown Winners:** For pitchers, the Triple Crown has been awarded 41 times to 31 different players in MLB history across the AL and NL, as well as other leagues with major league status like the American Association. Notable winners include Sandy Koufax, who struck out 382 batters in 1965, and Pedro Mart\u00ednez with 313 strikeouts in 1999. This achievement, while still rare, occurs more frequently than the batting Triple Crown (source: Baseball-Almanac.com and MLB.com).\n\n**Total Triple Crown Winners:** When combining both batting and pitching categories, there is no single 'total' count of Triple Crown winners often cited, as they are typically discussed separately due to the distinct nature of the achievements. However, if we consider unique individuals who have won either a batting or pitching Triple Crown, the lists do not overlap (no player has won both a batting and pitching Triple Crown). Thus, there are 23 unique batting winners and 31 unique pitching winners, totaling 54 distinct individuals who have achieved a Triple Crown in MLB history.\n\nIf you meant specifically batting or pitching Triple Crowns, or are looking for winners in a particular league or era, please let me know, and I can refine the answer further. For now, the most comprehensive answer is that there have been 28 batting Triple Crowns and 41 pitching Triple Crowns awarded in MLB history, accomplished by a combined total of 54 unique players.\n\n**Agent 3**: As of 2024, there have been 17 recognized Triple Crown seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), achieved by 15 unique players. The \"Triple Crown\" is earned by leading the league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) during a single season.\n\nHere are the Triple Crown winners:\n\n1. Paul Hines (1878)\n2. Tip O'Neill (1887)\n3. Hugh Duffy (1894)\n4. Nap Lajoie (1901)\n5. Ty Cobb (1909)\n6. Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n7. Chuck Klein (1933)\n8. Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n9. Lou Gehrig (1934)\n10.

There are two distinct types: the batting Triple Crown (leading in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in) and the pitching Triple Crown (leading in wins, earned run average, and strikeouts).\n\n- **Batting Triple Crown Winners**: There have been 28 batting Triple Crown achievements by 23 unique players across the American League (AL), National League (NL), and Negro Leagues (recognized as major league since 2020). Notable winners include Miguel Cabrera (2012, the most recent), Rogers Hornsby (twice), and Oscar Charleston (three times in the Negro Leagues). \n- **Pitching Triple Crown Winners**: There have been 41 pitching Triple Crown achievements by 31 unique pitchers in MLB history across the AL, NL, and other historical major leagues like the American Association. Recent winners include Tarik Skubal and Chris Sale in 2024.\n- **Total Unique Triple Crown Winners**: Since no individual has won both a batting and pitching Triple Crown, the total number of unique players who have achieved either feat is 23 (batting) + 31 (pitching) = 54 distinct Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\nThus, depending on the context, there are 54 unique individuals who have won a Triple Crown (batting or pitching) in MLB. If you are referring specifically to one category or a particular league, please clarify. (Sources: Baseball-Reference.com, MLB.com, and Wikipedia for historical and recent data as of 2024.)\n\n**Agent 2**: There have been 37 unique players who have won a Triple Crown in MLB baseball.\n\nThis can be broken down into:\n\n*   **14 unique batters** have won the Batting Triple Crown (leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs in the same season).\n*   **23 unique pitchers** have won the Pitching Triple Crown (leading their league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA in the same season).\n\n**Agent 3**: Agent 1 provides a more comprehensive and up-to-date answer than Agent 3, as it includes recent changes in MLB's official records, such as the inclusion of Negro Leagues statistics and a distinction between batting and pitching Triple Crowns.
