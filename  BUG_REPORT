Vote (fixed):
- No unique votes for each agent
- vote_counts is not correct: should be {"agent_id": "vote_count"}, start with 0

- ✅ Border alignment inconsistencies resolved
- ✅ Terminal width detection locked for consistent display
- ✅ Width calculation methods unified to prevent discrepancies 
- ✅ ANSI escape sequence handling improved
- ✅ Padding and truncation logic simplified for reliability
- ✅ Border validation method improved with unified width calculation
- ✅ Terminal resize detection added to reset cached dimensions
- ✅ Error handling improved with fallback display mode
