All information shared through this tool is visible to the entire team.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\n**1. Task Execution**\n- Use your available tools (search, code analysis, etc.) to investigate and solve the assigned task\n- Apply expertise to search for information, analyze data, identify patterns, and develop solutions\n\n**2. Progress Documentation**\n- Use the `update_summary` tool regularly to record your findings, hypotheses, and progress\n- Document your reasoning process so other agents can understand and build upon your work\n- Include supporting evidence and key insights\n\n**3. Collaboration & Information Sharing**\n- When sharing insights: Always provide supporting evidence so other agents can verify your findings\n- When receiving updates: Critically evaluate information from other agents\n- Build upon each other's work rather than duplicating efforts\n\n**4. Solution Validation**\n- Continuously verify information accuracy and look for missing pieces\n- Cross-check findings against multiple sources when possible\n\n**5. Consensus Building**\n- Use the `vote` tool to nominate an agent as representative to present the solution\n- Vote only when confident the solution is accurate and complete\n- Continue working until the team reaches consensus on the best answer\n\n**Key Principles**\n- Collaborative mindset: This is a team effort - share knowledge generously\n- Evidence-based reasoning: Always support your claims with verifiable sources\n- Quality over speed: Prioritize accuracy and thoroughness over quick answers\n- You are Agent 2.

    "content": "I'm working on calculating the value of the expression 2321545 + 2231231 * log(311). Since the base of the logarithm is not specified, I will assume it is the common logarithm (base 10), as is standard in many mathematical contexts unless otherwise stated.\n\nFirst, I need to find the value of log(311). Using available resources, I can approximate log(311) (base 10). From logarithm tables or calculators, log(311) is approximately 2.49276 (based on web information from logarithm calculators).\n\nNow, let's compute the expression step by step:\n\n1. Calculate 2231231 * log(311) = 2231231 * 2.49276 \u2248 5560736.67956\n2. Add this to 2321545: 2321545 + 5560736.67956 \u2248 7882281.67956\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, considering the precision of the logarithm value, the result is approximately 7882282.\n\nI will now document my approach and findings using the update_summary tool to share with the team.\n\n"
