The answers provide varying totals for Triple Crown winners in Major League Baseball (MLB)\u2014ranging from 56 to 73 instances\u2014due to differences in how they count batting and pitching Triple Crowns, and whether they include historical leagues like the Negro Leagues. This inconsistency highlights the need for a more precise and unified response based on reliable sources.\\n\\nTo resolve this, I'll draw from verified MLB records and historical data, including updates through the 2024 season (the most recent data available as of 2025). A Triple Crown in MLB is achieved by leading a league in specific statistical categories:\\n- **Batting Triple Crown**: Leading in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\\n- **Pitching Triple Crown**: Leading in wins, earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts.\\n\\n### Accurate Count of Triple Crown Winners\\nAs of the end of the 2024 MLB season, based on official records from sources like Baseball-Reference.com, Wikipedia, and Baseball Almanac:\\n\\n- **Batting Triple Crown Winners**: There have been **22 instances** of players achieving this feat. This includes 21 instances in the American League (AL) or National League (NL) from 1878 to 2012, plus one additional instance from the Negro Leagues (recognized by MLB since 2020). Notable winners include Ty Cobb (1909), Rogers Hornsby (1922 and 1925), Lou Gehrig (1934), Ted Williams (1942 and 1947), and Miguel Cabrera (2012, the most recent).\\n\\n- **Pitching Triple Crown Winners**: There have been **41 instances** across MLB history, with pitchers dominating in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. This count covers the AL and NL from 1877 to 2024, with recent winners including Chris Sale (Atlanta Braves, 2024) and Tarik Skubal (Detroit Tigers, 2024). Other legends include Grover Cleveland Alexander (1915) and Roger Clemens (1997 and 1998).\\n\\n**Total Triple Crown Winners (Instances)**: Combining both categories, there have been **63 instances** of Triple Crown achievements in MLB history.\\n\\nThis total is derived from comprehensive MLB databases and historical analyses, which confirm no new Triple Crown winners in 2025 as of the current date. The rarity of this accomplishment\u2014requiring exceptional dominance in multiple categories\u2014makes it one of baseball's most prestigious feats, with no batter achieving it since 2012 and pitchers continuing to occasionally reach it.\\n\\nIf you need further details, such as a full list of winners or clarification on specific eras, let me know.\"}"
