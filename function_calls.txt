      "answer": "This is a highly complex variant of the Towers of Hanoi problem, often referred to as the 'Multi-Peg Towers of Hanoi' or a generalized version where disks are initially distributed across multiple pegs and need to be consolidated onto a single target peg.\n\nHere's why finding the *minimal* number of moves for this specific scenario is exceptionally difficult:\n\n1.  **More than 3 Pegs:** The classic Towers of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known optimal solution of `2^n - 1` moves (where `n` is the number of disks). However, when more than 3 pegs are available (in this case, 5 pegs), the problem becomes significantly more complex. There is no universally proven optimal formula for the multi-peg version (often called the Frame-Stewart problem) even when moving all disks from one peg to another. Strategies exist that are *presumed* optimal, but they are not simple formulas and typically apply to moving a complete tower.\n\n2.  **Distributed Starting Position:** Unlike the standard problem where all disks start on a single peg, your disks are distributed across Pegs 0, 1, 2, and 3. This initial configuration adds another layer of complexity, as the solution involves not just moving a tower, but first organizing and consolidating these disparate disks.\n\n3.  **Consolidation Goal:** The goal is to consolidate all disks (1 through 9) onto a single target peg (Peg 4) in ascending order. This is different from merely moving a pre-existing tower.\n\nDue to these factors, calculating the absolute minimal number of moves for this exact setup (9 disks, 5 pegs, specific distributed starting position, and consolidation goal) is a computationally intensive task that often requires advanced search algorithms (like A* search) or dynamic programming approaches, and even then, finding the *global optimum* can be very challenging. There is no simple mathematical formula to derive this number. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise numerical answer for the minimal amount of moves."
