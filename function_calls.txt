The state space for this problem is extremely large, making a direct calculation or manual derivation impractical.\n\nTherefore, without the ability to run such a specialized algorithm, I cannot provide the exact minimal number of moves required to achieve the target configuration."

This would involve implementing and executing advanced search algorithms, such as A* search, often enhanced with heuristics like Pattern Databases (PDBs), to efficiently explore the vast state space of possible moves.\n\nGiven the computational complexity and the need for specialized algorithms, it is not possible to calculate the exact minimal number of moves for this specific puzzle setup without a dedicated solver.
