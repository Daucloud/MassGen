      "answer": "The problem you've described is a highly complex variation of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, often referred to as the \"Multi-peg Towers of Hanoi with an arbitrary initial configuration.\" Determining the minimal number of moves for such a setup is an NP-hard problem.\n\nHere's why it's not possible to provide a direct numerical answer:\n\n1.  **Multiple Pegs (5 pegs):** While the classic Towers of Hanoi involves 3 pegs, adding more pegs significantly increases the complexity. There is no simple closed-form formula for the minimal moves with an arbitrary number of disks on multiple pegs, especially when the disks are not all on a single starting peg.\n2.  **Arbitrary Initial Configuration:** Unlike standard Towers of Hanoi problems where all disks begin on one peg, your scenario has disks distributed across four different pegs. This initial state makes the problem much more intricate, as standard algorithms or formulas do not apply directly.\n3.  **Optimal Moves Requirement:** Finding the *absolute minimal* number of moves for an arbitrary configuration on multiple pegs typically requires advanced graph search algorithms (e.g., A* search) to explore the vast state space of possible disk arrangements. For 9 disks and 5 pegs, the number of possible states is immense, making an exhaustive search computationally prohibitive without a specialized solver.\n\nWithout access to a powerful computational solver specifically designed for this type of problem, it is not feasible to calculate the exact minimal number of moves. This problem cannot be solved with a simple formula or a set of rules; it requires a deep search of the state space."

There is no simple formula, and the state space is too vast for a direct calculation.

The search space, although large, is pruned by only considering legal moves (moving the top disk of one peg onto an empty peg or a larger disk on another peg).  \\n- The BFS terminates as soon as the goal (all disks on peg 4 in ascending order) is reached, guaranteeing minimality.\\n\\nThus, the optimal solution takes 21 moves.\"}",
