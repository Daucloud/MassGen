- [ ] Create deployment guides and production best practices

## Key Technical Priorities

1. **Backend Reliability**: Robust error handling and failover mechanisms
2. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient streaming and resource management
3. **User Experience**: Enhanced CLI interface and conversation management
4. **Production Features**: Monitoring, analytics, and deployment readiness

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All backends work reliably with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Backend switching and fallback mechanisms function correctly
- [ ] Conversation save/load and export features work seamlessly
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work (backward compatibility)

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Backends maintain <2s response times with retry mechanisms
- [ ] Memory usage remains efficient for long-running conversations
- [ ] Backend health checks complete in <500ms
- [ ] Configuration validation completes instantly

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for new backend and CLI features
- [ ] Zero regressions in existing multi-turn and coordination behavior
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation with production deployment guides
- [ ] User-friendly error messages and configuration validation

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Existing Backends**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and Grok backend foundation
- **Multi-Turn Architecture**: Current conversation context system
- **Configuration System**: YAML/JSON configuration management
- **Test Infrastructure**: Existing comprehensive test suite

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **Backend Reliability**: *Mitigation*: Comprehensive error handling and health monitoring
2. **Configuration Complexity**: *Mitigation*: Validation tools and interactive setup wizard
3. **Backward Compatibility**: *Mitigation*: Extensive regression testing
4. **Production Deployment**: *Mitigation*: Clear deployment guides and monitoring tools

## Post-v0.0.4 Considerations

### Future Enhancements (v0.0.5+)
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based conversation interface
- **API Server**: RESTful API for third-party integrations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conversation insights and optimization suggestions
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Image and file handling in conversations

### Long-term Vision
- **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, conversation sharing
- **Plugin System**: Extensible agent capabilities
- **Cloud Integration**: Hosted MassGen service
- **Advanced AI Features**: Auto-summarization, intelligent routing

## Timeline Summary

| Week | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Backend enhancement | Error handling, health checks, additional providers |
| 2 | CLI advanced features | Conversation management, enhanced UI, developer tools |
| 3 | Production features | Monitoring, analytics, plugin architecture |
| 4 | Release preparation | Documentation, testing, deployment guides |

## Getting Started

### For Contributors
1. Review existing backend implementations in `massgen/backend/`
2. Check the current multi-turn conversation system in `massgen/orchestrator.py`
