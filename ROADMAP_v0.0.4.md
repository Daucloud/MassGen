# MassGen v0.0.4 Roadmap

## Overview

MassGen v0.0.4 focuses on **Multi-Turn Conversation Support** and **Enhanced User Experience**.

- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization

#### 3.3 Quality Assurance
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing
- [ ] Load testing with various conversation patterns
- [ ] Documentation updates and examples
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Multi-Turn Architecture

Based on the proven v0.0.1 approach, implementing **dynamic context reconstruction**:

```python
# Core pattern: Agents rebuild context dynamically
def _build_agent_context(self, conversation_history, current_task, agent_answers):
    """Build agent context dynamically based on current state."""
    
    # Format conversation history for agent context
    history_context = self._format_conversation_history(conversation_history)
    
    # Build coordination context with full history
    coordination_context = self.message_templates.build_coordination_context(
        current_task=current_task,
        conversation_history=history_context,
        agent_answers=agent_answers,
        voting_state=self._get_voting_state()
    )
    
    return {
        "system_message": self.message_templates.system_message_with_context(history_context),
        "user_message": coordination_context,
        "tools": self.workflow_tools
    }
```

### Key Technical Priorities

1. **Context Management**: Efficient handling of conversation history without memory bloat
2. **Dynamic Reconstruction**: Agents always work with fresh, complete context
3. **CLI Integration**: Seamless multi-turn experience in terminal interface
4. **Backend Optimization**: Leverage CLI backends effectively for streaming conversations

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations work correctly across all agent configurations
- [ ] Conversation history is preserved and utilized by agents
- [ ] CLI displays coordination properly in multi-turn scenarios
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work (backward compatibility)

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations handle 10+ exchanges without degradation
- [ ] Context building completes in <100ms for typical conversations
- [ ] Memory usage scales linearly with conversation length
- [ ] CLI backends maintain <2s response times

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for multi-turn functionality
- [ ] Zero regressions in existing single-turn behavior
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation with examples
- [ ] User-friendly error messages and help text

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **MessageTemplates**: Core system for building agent context
- **CLI Backends**: Claude Code CLI and Gemini CLI must remain stable
- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination logic needs updates
- **Frontend UI**: Terminal coordination interface requires improvements

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **Context Size Explosion**: *Mitigation*: Implement intelligent truncation and summarization
2. **Performance Degradation**: *Mitigation*: Comprehensive performance testing and optimization
3. **Backward Compatibility**: *Mitigation*: Extensive regression testing
4. **CLI Backend Stability**: *Mitigation*: Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Post-v0.0.4 Considerations

### Future Enhancements (v0.0.5+)
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based conversation interface
- **API Server**: RESTful API for third-party integrations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conversation insights and optimization suggestions
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Image and file handling in conversations

### Long-term Vision
- **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, conversation sharing
- **Plugin System**: Extensible agent capabilities
- **Cloud Integration**: Hosted MassGen service
- **Advanced AI Features**: Auto-summarization, intelligent routing
