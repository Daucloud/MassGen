# Reasoning Streaming Implementation Notes

## Overview
Based on analysis of the MassGen codebase, here are key insights about how reasoning streaming works, particularly for OpenAI GPT-5 series and O-series models.

## Key Implementation Details

### OpenAI Backend Configuration
- **Reasoning Parameter**: `reasoning.effort` can be set to "low", "medium", or "high" 
- **Mutual Exclusivity**: Reasoning and web search cannot be enabled simultaneously
- **Model Support**: GPT-5 series (gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano) and GPT O-series models
- **Response Format**: When reasoning is enabled, the model provides structured reasoning traces

### Configuration Examples
```yaml
backend:
  type: "openai"
  model: "gpt-5-nano"
  reasoning:
    effort: "high"  # Options: low, medium, high
  # Note: enable_web_search must be false when reasoning is enabled
```

### Multi-Agent Reasoning Scenarios
In the case studies examined:
- **Agent 1**: `reasoning.effort: "minimal"` - Basic safety-focused approaches
- **Agent 2**: `reasoning.effort: "medium"` - Structured comprehensive frameworks  
- **Agent 3**: `reasoning.effort: "high"` - Advanced systematic analysis

### Reasoning Quality Progression
Higher reasoning effort levels consistently produce:
- More sophisticated analysis and synthesis
- Better integration of multiple dimensions (technical, philosophical, societal)
- Enhanced strategic thinking and implementation frameworks
- Superior consensus-building through cross-agent evaluation

### Stream Processing
The OpenAI backend likely handles reasoning traces through:
- Structured streaming events that separate reasoning from final responses
- Progressive revelation of thinking process to users
- Integration with MassGen's StreamChunk format for consistent display

## Implementation Considerations
- Reasoning streams may require different parsing than standard chat completions
- UI must handle both reasoning traces and final outputs appropriately
- Token usage and cost implications for extended reasoning processes
- Performance optimization for real-time reasoning stream display

## Future Enhancements
- Support for other providers' reasoning capabilities (Claude's thinking, Gemini's reasoning)
- Configurable reasoning display modes (full traces vs. summaries)
- Reasoning quality metrics and evaluation frameworks
