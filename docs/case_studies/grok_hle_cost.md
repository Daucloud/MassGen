# MassGen Case Study: Estimating Grok-4 HLE Benchmark Costs

This case study demonstrates MassGen's ability to converge on a detailed and well-supported answer for a technical query, showcasing iterative refinement and dynamic voting.

**Command:**
```bash
python cli.py --config examples/fast_config.yaml "How much does it cost to run HLE benchmark with Grok-4"
```

**Prompt:** `How much does it cost to run HLE benchmark with Grok-4`

**Agents:**
*   Agent 1: `gpt-4o`
*   Agent 2: `gemini-2.5-flash`
*   Agent 3: `grok-3-mini` (Designated Representative Agent)

## The Collaborative Process

### Initial Responses and Iterative Refinement

All three agents provided initial estimates for the cost of running the HLE benchmark with Grok-4, focusing on xAI's token-based pricing. However, Agent 3 (`grok-3-mini`) distinguished itself through a highly iterative refinement process, updating its answer 13 times throughout the session. This frequent updating allowed Agent 3 to incorporate more details, refine its cost estimations, and improve the clarity and structure of its response.

### Dynamic Voting and Consensus

The voting process in this session was particularly insightful:

1.  **Agent 1 (`gpt-4o`)** consistently voted for its own answer, maintaining its initial perspective.
2.  **Agent 3 (`grok-3-mini`)** also consistently voted for its own answer, reflecting its continuous refinement and growing confidence in its detailed response.
3.  **Agent 2 (`gemini-2.5-flash`)** initially voted for its own answer. However, after observing Agent 3's numerous updates and the increasing comprehensiveness of its response, **Agent 2 changed its vote to support Agent 3's answer**.

This shift in Agent 2's vote, combined with Agent 3's self-vote, led to Agent 3's answer receiving the majority of votes (2 out of 3), resulting in a clear consensus.

## The Final Answer

Agent 3's answer was chosen as the final output. It provided a comprehensive breakdown of Grok-4's API pricing, estimated token consumption for the HLE benchmark, and a detailed cost breakdown, including additional factors like subscription requirements and potential cost variations. The answer was well-structured, clearly sourced (from xAI's documentation and AI benchmarking discussions), and provided a realistic range for the estimated cost.

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates MassGen's effectiveness in handling complex, technical queries that require detailed research and estimation. The iterative refinement process, particularly by Agent 3, combined with the dynamic voting where Agent 2 shifted its support, highlights the system's ability to converge on a high-quality, well-supported answer. This showcases MassGen's strength in achieving robust consensus even in scenarios requiring deep domain-specific knowledge and continuous information synthesis.
