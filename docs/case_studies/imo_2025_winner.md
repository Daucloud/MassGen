# MassGen Case Study: The IMO 2025 Winner

This case study showcases how MassGen (v0.0.1alpha) orchestrated a collaboration between two leading AI models to produce a nuanced, accurate, and well-sourced answer to a complex question.

**Command:**
```bash
uv run python cli.py "Which AI won IMO 2025?" --models gemini-2.5-flash gpt-4.1
```

**Prompt:** `Which AI won IMO 2025?`

**Agents:**
*   Agent 1: `gemini-2.5-flash`
*   Agent 2: `gpt-4.1`

## The Collaborative Process

### Initial Answers

Initially, the two agents provided different answers:

*   **Agent 2 (gpt-4.1)** at first stated that no AI had officially participated in or won the IMO, as it is traditionally a human-only competition.
*   **Agent 1 (gemini-2.5-flash)** correctly stated that both Google DeepMind and OpenAI had achieved gold-level scores, but did not initially differentiate between official and unofficial participation.

### Intelligence Sharing and Refinement

Through MassGen's real-time intelligence sharing, the agents were able to see each other's responses. This led to a rapid refinement of their answers:

1.  **Agent 2**, seeing Agent 1's more current information, updated its answer to reflect the recent news. It went a step further by finding sources and clarifying the crucial distinction between Google's *official* participation and OpenAI's *unofficial* one.
2.  **Agent 1**, while initially correct, was less detailed. It updated its answer to be more comprehensive, but still lacked the clear distinction and sourcing of Agent 2's final answer.

### The Vote: Reaching Consensus

The final phase of the process was the vote. Here's how it played out:

*   **Agent 2** voted for its own answer, citing its superior sourcing, clarity on the official vs. unofficial status, and inclusion of references.
*   **Agent 1** voted for **Agent 2's** answer, acknowledging that it was more accurate and nuanced due to the distinction it made between the two AI's participation.

This resulted in a unanimous consensus, with both agents agreeing that Agent 2's answer was the best.

## The Final Answer

The final, consensus-driven answer was a comprehensive and well-structured summary of the situation, correctly identifying Google DeepMind's Gemini Deep Think as the official winner, while also acknowledging OpenAI's unofficial achievement and the superior performance of the top human contestants. The inclusion of sources and a clear summary table made the final answer highly valuable.

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates the power of MassGen's collaborative approach. By enabling agents to share information and refine their work in real-time, the system was able to produce a final answer that was more accurate, detailed, and reliable than what either agent could have produced on its own. The consensus-driven process ensured that the best answer was chosen, resulting in a high-quality output for the user.
