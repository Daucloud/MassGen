    "content": "I have researched the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025, hosted by the Berkeley Center for Responsible Decentralized Intelligence, taking place on August 2, 2025, at UC Berkeley. While I have access to general information about the summit, including its focus on agentic AI and autonomous systems, specific details about individual talks on agent frameworks are not fully available in the public domain at this time. \n\nBased on posts found on X and web information, the summit features a range of speakers and topics related to agentic AI, including discussions on next-generation AI agent architectures and human-agent collaboration. Notable mentions include a lightning talk by Zhengzhong Tu on '#4KAgent' and a focus talk by PyTorch experts on accelerating open-source AI. Additionally, Dawn Song, a prominent figure at UC Berkeley, highlighted the event's significance with over 2,000 in-person attendees and a livestream for a global audience. However, a detailed schedule of all talks specifically on agent frameworks is not listed in the sources I accessed.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information on talks related to agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025, I recommend checking the official event website (https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit) or the livestream page (https://lu.ma/agentic-ai-summit-livestream) for the latest agenda and speaker lineup. If you need assistance with accessing specific talks or further details as they become available, please let me know!"

[02:16:58] [THINKING] üîÅ Agent [grok3] gracefully restarting due to new answer detected
After reviewing the current answers provided by the agents, I find that none of them comprehensively address the request in the original message to list all the talks on agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025. Agent1 provides a partial list of talks, mentioning a keynote and focus talks by specific speakers, but it lacks completeness and specificity regarding whether these are indeed all the talks on agent frameworks. Agent2 offers no specific information at all.

Given the lack of a complete and detailed response, I will provide an improved answer using available web information to ensure the original message is addressed as thoroughly as possible.


[02:17:11] [THINKING] üí° Providing answer: "Unfortunately, I was unable to find a complete and detailed schedule of all the talks specifically focused on agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025. However, I can provide some information based on available web sources about the summit and related events.

The Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025, hosted by the Center for Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence at UC Berkeley, is set to bring together leaders from academia, industry, and policy to discuss the future of AI and agentic systems. While specific talks on agent frameworks are not fully detailed in the public domain at this time, the summit's focus includes exploring autonomous AI systems and related technologies, which likely encompass agent frameworks.

Here are some highlights based on available information:
1. **Keynote by Ion Stoica** at 10:45 AM - As a co-founder of Databricks & Anyscale and a professor at UC Berkeley, Stoica is expected to discuss agentic systems, which may include insights into agent frameworks.
2. **Focus Talks at 11:05 AM** - Featuring Matei Zaharia (CTO of Databricks and Associate Professor at UC Berkeley) and Sherwin Wu (Head of Engineering, OpenAI API), these sessions are anticipated to cover topics relevant to AI agent engineering and frameworks.

For a complete list of talks on agent frameworks, I recommend visiting the official summit website at https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit or checking the event's agenda on platforms like https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/inactive.php?eventid=842399 or the livestream page at https://lu.ma/agentic-ai-summit-livestream. Additionally, recent articles and updates from sources like ODSC on Medium (https://odsc.medium.com/from-architecture-to-execution-inside-week-2-of-the-agentic-ai-summit-88baa36ca3b5) discuss broader themes of agentic AI summits, including frameworks, which might provide further context.

If you have access to the summit's program or specific session titles, I can help refine this information further."

After reviewing the current answers provided by the agents, I find that while Agent 1 and Agent 3 offer some relevant information about talks on agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025, their responses are not comprehensive enough to fully address the original request of providing "all the talks" on agent frameworks. Agent 2's response does not provide any specific information and is therefore not helpful.

Agent 1 and Agent 3 both mention a keynote by Ion Stoica and focus talks by Matei Zaharia and Sherwin Wu under the session "Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems," which are relevant. They also note the summit's focus on workshops and discussions related to multi-agent applications and agent evaluation, which likely include agent frameworks. However, neither agent claims to have access to the complete list of talks, and both responses lack additional specific sessions or titles that might be part of the summit agenda. Given that the request explicitly asks for "all the talks," the current answers fall short of fulfilling this requirement.

Since I also do not have access to the full schedule of the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025 beyond what is provided in the current answers and the web information available, I cannot provide a complete list of all talks on agent frameworks. However, I can improve upon the existing answers by consolidating the relevant information and providing clear guidance on where to find the complete details.

Therefore, I will use the `new_answer` tool to provide an improved response to the original message.

[02:19:46] [THINKING] ‚ùå Agent failed to use workflow tools after 3 attempts
After reviewing the current answers provided by the agents regarding the talks on agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025, I have determined that while some relevant information is provided, there is room for a more comprehensive and detailed response to fully address the original message.

Agent1 and Agent3 provide specific details about a session titled "Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems," including key speakers and times, which is directly relevant to the user's request. Agent3 expands on this by mentioning additional themes like multi-agent applications and test-driven agent development, and also provides source links for further reference. However, neither agent offers a complete list of all talks on agent frameworks, and Agent2 offers no specific information at all.

Given that the original message explicitly asks for "all the talks on agent frameworks," and considering the possibility that more talks or sessions might be available beyond what is currently mentioned, I believe a more thorough answer is needed. Since I do not have access to the full agenda or additional unreported sessions from the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025, I will craft an improved answer that consolidates the available information, acknowledges the limitation, and provides actionable guidance for obtaining the complete list.


[02:19:58] [THINKING] üí° Providing answer: "While a complete list of all talks on agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025 is not fully available in public sources at this time, I can provide details on key sessions and themes based on information from the Berkeley Center for Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence (https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/agentic-ai-summit) and related event pages.

Here are the highlighted sessions relevant to agent frameworks at the Berkeley Agentic AI Summit 2025:
1. **Session: Frameworks & Stacks for Agentic Systems**
   - **10:45 AM ‚Äì Keynote by Ion Stoica**: Co-Founder of Databricks & Anyscale and Professor at UC Berkeley, likely discussing foundational aspects of agentic systems, including frameworks.
   - **11:05 AM ‚Äì Focus Talks**:
     - *Matei Zaharia*: Co-Founder/CTO of Databricks and Associate Professor at UC Berkeley, expected to cover technical insights into agentic frameworks.
     - *Sherwin Wu*: Head of Engineering, OpenAI API at OpenAI, potentially addressing API integrations and frameworks for agentic AI.

Additionally, the summit features workshops and talks on related topics such as building multi-agent applications, agent evaluation, and test-driven agent development, which are expected to include discussions on agent frameworks. Recent articles, such as those on Medium by ODSC (https://odsc.medium.com/from-architecture-to-execution-inside-week-2-of-the-agentic-ai-summit-88baa36ca3b5), suggest that agentic AI summits often dive into the engineering realities of agent frameworks, from protocol-level orchestration to enterprise deployment.

For a comprehensive list of all talks on agent frameworks, I recommend visiting the official summit website or event registration page (https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/inactive.php?eventid=842399) for the full agenda. Livestream information may also be available at https://lu.ma/agentic-ai-summit-livestream.
