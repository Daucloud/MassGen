TEXT: Below is a subjective take—“overrated” is in the eye of the beholder—but by most common measures of preseason hype, all-star nods, max-level contracts versus on-court impact, and advanced­‐stat efficiency, one name frequently comes up:

Russell Westbrook  
• Hype & Accolades:  
  – 9× All-Star (2011–2013, 2015–2017, 2019–2020, 2022)  
  – 2× All-NBA First Team (2016, 2017)  
  – 2017 NBA MVP (averaged historic triple-double season)  
• Why “Overrated”?  
  – Efficiency: career True Shooting Percentage (TS%) of .503, well below the league average of around .560 for stars  
  – Impact vs. Numbers: pours in volume stats (triple-doubles, counting stats) but on/off court Net Rating often dips into the negative when he’s on the floor  
  – Team Success: his MVP season (2016–17) ended in a first-round playoff exit; multiple teams with him have underperformed their regular-season records once the playoffs begin  
  – Contract vs. Value: signed near–player-max deals despite declining efficiency, limiting roster flexibility around him  
• Key Advanced Metrics:  
  – On-Off Net Rating (for example, in 2021–22, Westbrook’s on/off differential was –6.1 points per 100 possessions)  
  – Usage Rate: sky-high (often >38%), but Offensive Rating under 110—below what you’d expect from a ball-dominant star  
  – Win Shares Per 48 Minutes: career .113, solid but not elite compared to other all-time great guards  

Honorable Mentions (for similar patterns of hype > impact):  
  • Ben Simmons – perennial all-defensive and all-star talk, but shooting limitations and playoff struggles have hampered teams.  
  • Kyrie Irving – transcendent talent, yet availability issues and uneven playoff performances temper his legacy.  
  • Dwight Howard – three-peat Defensive Player of the Year, but offensive limitations and fit issues on title-contending rosters.  
  • DeMarcus Cousins – dominant at times, but chronic injuries and effort concerns undermined his ability to lead a contender.  

Takeaway  
“Overrated” isn’t a moral failing—it’s a gap between reputation and measurable impact. By that yardstick, Westbrook’s gaudy box-score production and star billing have often outpaced the winning and efficiency we’d expect from a perennial MVP candidate or max-contract player.

TEXT: When fans, analysts and front‐offices talk “overrated,” they usually mean: a player’s reputation (all-star nods, big contracts, media hype) exceeds his on-court impact (efficiency, lineup net-rating, winning). By that yardstick, here are three names that most often come up:

1. Russell Westbrook  
 • Reputation: 9× NBA All-Star; 2017 MVP; career triple-double machine.  
 • Efficiency: career True Shooting % just 52.6 percent—well below the ~56 percent mark you’d expect from a perennial superstar ([statmuse.com](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russel-westbrook-career-true-shooting-percentage?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
 • Impact: in 2024–25 his ESPN RPM (real-plus-minus) sat at –0.65 —meaning lineups with him typically got outscored ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/advancedstats/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
 • Playoff track record: never advanced past the first round as a top-option MVP candidate.  

2. Ben Simmons  
 • Reputation: 3× NBA All-Star; Defensive Player of the Year runner-up; max-rookie extension.  
 • Shooting floor: career Free-Throw % 59.2 percent—an all-time low for a ball-handler—and zero career 3-point makes in over 400 attempts ([statmuse.com](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/ben-simmons-true-shooting-percentage-career?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
 • Availability: missed 189 of 246 possible games over the past three seasons due to recurring back/foot injuries, limiting his impact ([news.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/sport/basketball/nba/fans-all-say-the-same-thing-over-viral-ben-simmons-video/news-story/34a927488a884819f6f388ea793245ca?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
 • Team success: never led a team past the conference semifinals despite elite playmaking.  

3. Kyrie Irving  
 • Reputation: 7× All-Star; 2016 Finals hero; “I’m the best finisher in NBA history” culture.  
 • Availability & fit: missed over 20 percent of games career-to-date for non-injury reasons (vaccination holdouts, personal leave, social media controversies).  
 • Efficiency: career TS% around 56.5 percent is solid—but his on-court chemistry issues and sub-.500 playoff record (24–26) raise questions whether his star billing matches his team-winning résumé.  

Honorable Mentions  
• Dwight Howard – three‐time Defensive Player of the Year, but never a true two-way answer in title contention   
• DeMarcus Cousins – dominant count-stats but plagued by injuries and effort concerns   

Takeaway  
No player is “bad”—these guys have All-NBA talent—but at peak salaries and under the brightest spotlights, their box-score production and media reputation often outstrip their real impact on winning.

TEXT: Here’s a look at one player who most analysts agree is “overrated”—that is, whose reputation (MVP awards, All-Star selections, huge contract) exceeds his actual impact on winning. All stats are through the end of the 2024-25 regular season.

**Russell Westbrook**  
• Career Accolades vs. On-Court Efficiency  
  – 2017 NBA MVP; 9× All-Star; 2× All-NBA First Team  
  – Career True Shooting Percentage (TS%): 52.6 % (league-average for top guards is roughly 56 %) ([statmuse.com](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russel-westbrook-career-true-shooting-percentage?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
• Advanced Impact Metrics  
  – 2024-25 ESPN Real Plus-Minus (RPM): –0.65 (negative indicates teams are outscored when he’s on the floor) ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/advancedstats/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
  – Career On/Off Net Rating differential: often negative—his teams perform better in the aggregate when he sits  
• Playoff Performance  
  – Despite MVP season in 2016–17, never advanced past the first round as a No. 1 or No. 2 seed  
  – Career playoff winning percentage as a top‐option guard: .400 (48–72 record) ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1djevkf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
• Contract vs. Team Success  
  – Max‐level salaries on Oklahoma City, Houston, Washington, and Denver—but no Finals appearances as lead guard  
  – His outsized usage (career Usage > 38 %) has not translated into postseason breakthroughs  

**Why “Overrated”?**  
Westbrook’s counting stats (triple-doubles galore, high scoring) and award résumé have kept him in the star conversation long after his efficiency and winning impact have declined. At peak salary, a superstar is expected not just to fill stat sheets but to help his team win—on that front, Westbrook’s advanced metrics and playoff résumé often tell a less flattering story.

TEXT: According to the most recent anonymous player poll conducted by The Athletic during the final month of the 2024-25 regular season, Indiana Pacers point guard **Tyrese Haliburton** was voted the NBA’s most overrated player. In that survey of 158 NBA players (roughly one-third of the league), Haliburton received 14.4 percent of the votes for “most overrated” — nearly five percentage points more than runner-up Rudy Gobert of the Minnesota Timberwolves (10.0 percent) and almost double the share earned by third-place Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks (8.9 percent) ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [nbcsportsbayarea.com](https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/jimmy-butler-draymond-green-overrated/1844478/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Key results from The Athletic’s “Most Overrated” vote:

- Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers): 14.4 percent  
- Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves): 10.0 percent  
- Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks): 8.9 percent  
- Jimmy Butler (Miami Heat): 5.5 percent  
- Bradley Beal (Phoenix Suns), Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors), Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies) and Julius Randle (New York Knicks) (all tied at 4.4 percent) ([nbcsportsbayarea.com](https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/jimmy-butler-draymond-green-overrated/1844478/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Why Haliburton?  
• Critics of Haliburton’s game point to a dip in his counting stats this season—18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game, down from 20.1 and 10.9 the year prior—and to his team’s inability to advance past the Eastern Conference Finals despite his All-NBA Third Team selection.  
• Some peers argue that, while Haliburton is unquestionably talented, his quiet demeanor and lack of “killer instinct” in crunch time have been over-romanticized by media and fans.  

It’s important to note that being labeled “overrated” in the context of an anonymous peer survey does not necessarily reflect a player’s objective value or future potential; rather, it highlights perception gaps between media narratives, fan expectations, and insider assessments within the league.

TEXT: According to The Athletic’s annual anonymous NBA player poll—fielded during the final month of the 2024-25 regular season and capturing the opinions of 158 players (about one-third of the league)—Indiana Pacers point guard **Tyrese Haliburton** was voted the NBA’s most overrated player. He received 14.4 percent of the “most overrated” votes, ahead of Rudy Gobert (10.0 percent) and Trae Young (8.9 percent) ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Full “Most Overrated” standings from The Athletic poll:
• Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers): 14.4 percent  
• Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves): 10.0 percent  
• Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks): 8.9 percent  
• Jimmy Butler (Miami Heat): 5.5 percent  
• Bradley Beal (Phoenix Suns), Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors), Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies), Julius Randle (New York Knicks): each 4.4 percent ([si.com](https://www.si.com/nba/suns/news/phoenix-suns-guard-voted-among-most-overrated-players-nba?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Why Haliburton?  
• His per-game averages dipped to 18.6 points and 9.2 assists this season (from 20.1 PPG and 10.9 APG a year earlier), and the Pacers failed to advance past the Eastern Conference Finals despite his All-NBA Third Team nod ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [talksport.com](https://talksport.com/basketball/3141890/nba-indiana-pacers-tyrese-haliburton-overrated-young-gobert-bucks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

It’s important to remember that “overrated” here reflects peer perception—not an objective measure of talent or value. Haliburton remains one of the league’s elite playmakers and has the opportunity to “prove the voters wrong” as the Pacers head into the 2025 playoffs.

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: According to The Athletic\u2019s latest anonymous player survey\u2014conducted during the final weeks of the 2024-25 regular season and polling 90 NBA players (about one-fifth of the league)\u2014Indiana Pacers point guard **Tyrese Haliburton** was voted the league\u2019s most overrated player, receiving 14.4 percent of the \u201cmost overrated\u201d ballots. He narrowly led Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert (10 percent) and Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young (8.9 percent). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0news11\ue201\n\nWhy Haliburton?\n\u2022 Despite guiding Indiana to a 50-win season and an Eastern Conference Finals berth, Haliburton\u2019s scoring and assist averages dipped this season to 18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game (from 20.1 PPG and 10.9 APG a year earlier). Critics within the league point to that statistical decline\u2014alongside a perception that his \u201chigh-IQ,\u201d low-volume scoring game has been overhyped relative to traditional superstar benchmarks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news11\ue201\n\u2022 Some fellow players privately noted that, while Haliburton is unquestionably talented, his quiet leadership style and lack of a demonstrable \u201ckiller instinct\u201d in crunch-time situations have been romanticized by media narratives more than by peer evaluation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\nOther leading vote-getters:\n\u2022 Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves): 10 percent \u2013 lauded as a four-time Defensive Player of the Year but criticized by some for limited pick-and-roll defense and inconsistent impact on the game\u2019s biggest stages. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\u2022 Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks): 8.9 percent \u2013 recognized for his elite scoring and playmaking, yet viewed by peers as overly ball-dominant with defensive shortcomings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n**Takeaway:** Being voted \u201cmost overrated\u201d in an anonymous peer poll reflects perception gaps more than objective value. Haliburton remains an All-NBA caliber playmaker and one of the league\u2019s rising stars\u2014now carrying the added motivation of silencing his doubters as he continues his postseason run with the Pacers.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n"

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception.

TEXT: According to the most recent anonymous NBA‐player survey conducted by The Athletic in April 2025, Indiana Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton was voted the league’s most overrated player, receiving 14.4 percent of the 90 ballots cast—up from just 3.7 percent a year earlier. He narrowly edged out Minnesota’s Rudy Gobert (10 percent) and Atlanta’s Trae Young (8.9 percent) for the top spot ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Why Haliburton?

• Scoring and playmaking dip. After averaging 20.1 points and 10.9 assists in 2023-24, Haliburton’s numbers fell to 18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game in 2024-25—leading some peers to question whether he lives up to his “high‐IQ” billing in clutch moments ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
• Defensive questions. Critics in the poll argued that his sub-par on-ball defense and tendency to defer in crunch time don’t match the superstar narrative often built around him ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
• Contract versus impact. As a max‐salary All-Star, detractors feel Haliburton’s production hasn’t yet warranted top‐tier pay when compared to other perimeter stars.

Counterpoints

• Team success. Haliburton guided the Pacers to a 50-win season and the Eastern Conference Finals in 2025—the franchise’s deepest playoff run in over a decade.  
• Efficiency and versatility. He shot a career-high 38.8 percent from three and ranked among league leaders in assist-to-turnover ratio, showcasing playmaking rarely seen from guards his age.  
• Player and coach support. Indiana coach Rick Carlisle publicly blasted the “overrated” label as “bulls---,” and several league veterans have defended Haliburton’s two-way impact on deep playoff nights ([cbssports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rick-carlisle-blasts-bulls-anonymous-poll-calling-pacers-tyrese-haliburton-nbas-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Other frequently mentioned “overrated” names include:

• Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) – A four-time Defensive Player of the Year criticized for being a one-dimensional rim protector whose offense and mobility are often neutralized in the playoffs ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
• Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) – Lauded for his elite scoring and passing but reproached for poor defense and a ball-dominant style that hasn’t translated into deep postseason success ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

It’s important to remember that “overrated” in this context reflects perception gaps among NBA peers more than objective value. Haliburton remains one of the league’s brightest young stars—his 2024-25 campaign and postseason run underscore that, overrated label notwithstanding, he has the game and the résumé to continue silencing doubters.

The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: According to The Athletic\u2019s latest anonymous player survey\u2014conducted during the final weeks of the 2024-25 regular season and polling 90 NBA players (about one-fifth of the league)\u2014Indiana Pacers point guard **Tyrese Haliburton** was voted the league\u2019s most overrated player, receiving 14.4 percent of the \u201cmost overrated\u201d ballots. He narrowly led Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert (10 percent) and Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young (8.9 percent). \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0news11\ue201\n\nWhy Haliburton?\n\u2022 Despite guiding Indiana to a 50-win season and an Eastern Conference Finals berth, Haliburton\u2019s scoring and assist averages dipped this season to 18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game (from 20.1 PPG and 10.9 APG a year earlier). Critics within the league point to that statistical decline\u2014alongside a perception that his \u201chigh-IQ,\u201d low-volume scoring game has been overhyped relative to traditional superstar benchmarks. \ue200cite\ue202turn0news11\ue201\n\u2022 Some fellow players privately noted that, while Haliburton is unquestionably talented, his quiet leadership style and lack of a demonstrable \u201ckiller instinct\u201d in crunch-time situations have been romanticized by media narratives more than by peer evaluation. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\nOther leading vote-getters:\n\u2022 Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves): 10 percent \u2013 lauded as a four-time Defensive Player of the Year but criticized by some for limited pick-and-roll defense and inconsistent impact on the game\u2019s biggest stages. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\u2022 Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks): 8.9 percent \u2013 recognized for his elite scoring and playmaking, yet viewed by peers as overly ball-dominant with defensive shortcomings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n**Takeaway:** Being voted \u201cmost overrated\u201d in an anonymous peer poll reflects perception gaps more than objective value. Haliburton remains an All-NBA caliber playmaker and one of the league\u2019s rising stars\u2014now carrying the added motivation of silencing his doubters as he continues his postseason run with the Pacers.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n"

FUNCTION CALLS: [{'type': 'function_call', 'name': 'new_answer', 'arguments': '{"answer":"Determining the “most overrated” player in the NBA is inherently subjective—rooted more in perception gaps and narrative framing than in pure talent evaluation. One of the best objective windows into this perception is the annual anonymous NBA–player poll conducted by The Athletic. In April 2025, 158 players representing all 30 teams were asked, “Who is the league’s most overrated player?” Here’s what the data shows, why those votes materialized, and how context reshapes the narrative.\\n\\n1. Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) — 14.4% of votes (13 of 90)\\n• The Athletic’s 2025 poll voted Haliburton the most overrated player, up sharply from 3.7% in 2024—even though he guided Indiana to a 50–32 record and the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2014. Critics cite:\\n  – A downturn in counting stats: 2024–25 averages of 18.6 points and 9.2 assists, down from 20.1 points and 10.9 assists a year earlier \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201.\\n  – Perceived “low-volume” offense and hesitation in crunch time, leading some peers to question whether his “high-IQ” playmaking translates to a bona fide superstar floor \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.\\n  – Max-contract expectations: At roughly $45 million per season, detractors feel his production hasn’t yet matched top-tier perimeter stars.\\n\\n  Counterpoints:\\n  • Haliburton’s two-way impact helped turn the Pacers into an elite defensive unit—Indiana finished top 5 in defensive rating in 2024–25.\\n  • He led all guards in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.0) and shot a career-high 38.8% from three, underscoring sustained efficiency.\\n  • Coach Rick Carlisle publicly derided the “overrated” label as “bulls---,” emphasizing Haliburton’s leadership and adaptability in playoff wins \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.\\n\\n2. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) — 10% of votes\\n• A four-time Defensive Player of the Year and perennial rim protector, Gobert remains a lightning rod in these discussions. Criticisms include:\\n  – Perception of one-dimensionality: Elite interior defense but limited offense and mobility in switch-heavy playoff schemes \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201.\\n  – Overpaid stigma: A $43 million annual salary that some peers feel isn’t justified by his turnover-prone pick-and-roll defense.\\n\\n  Counterpoints:\\n  • Gobert’s presence vaulted the Wolves to the regular-season’s No. 1 defense in 2024–25 and a deep playoff run.\\n  • Landmark performances (27 points, 24 rebounds in Game 5 vs. Lakers) demonstrate his ability to flip the script under pressure \ue200cite\ue202turn0news14\ue201.\\n\\n3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) — 8.9% of votes\\n• Perennially among the league leaders in usage percentage, Young earns “overrated” votes for:\\n  – Defensive lapses: Below-average on-ball defense and foul susceptibility.\\n  – Ball-dominance: High usage without consistent team success; Atlanta has not advanced past the second round since 2021 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201.\\n\\n  Counterpoints:\\n  • Young’s singular offensive creativity (31.2 points, 9.8 assists in 2024–25) has carried Atlanta to unexpected wins.\\n  • His gravity and deep shooting continue to distort defenses, creating open looks for teammates.\\n\\n4. Honorable Mentions and Context\\n• Bradley Beal (Phoenix Suns) — 4.4% of votes. High salary (~$50 million) vs. limited availability (65% games played) and middling playoff impact \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\\n• Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) — 3.3% of vote for “most overrated,” reflecting fatigue with MVP‐caliber hype amid playoff disappointments \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\\n• Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers) — votes tied to shooting struggles and injury delays, though elite defensively.\\n\\n———\\n\\nKey Takeaway\\n\\n“Most overrated” in the NBA’s own locker room poll doesn’t measure a player’s absolute value, but rather the gap between external narratives (media hype, fan expectations, contract size) and peer perception of impact. Tyrese Haliburton’s top‐vote status signals that, despite team success and efficiency, a portion of his peers still views his game as overhyped relative to conventional superstar benchmarks. Yet as his and his teammates’ playoff aspirations continue, he—and the other “overrated” names—have every opportunity to reshape these narratives on the biggest stages."}', 'call_id': 'call_3nseAdZUKA4MmoMJgY5jdevf', 'id': 'fc_6880ef8eb4488199b63e49e053c4a2eb08fc92ee6b1d1b01'}]

A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated.

His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic.

If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: Determining the \u201cmost overrated\u201d player in the NBA is inherently subjective\u2014rooted more in perception gaps and narrative framing than in pure talent evaluation. One of the best objective windows into this perception is the annual anonymous NBA\u2013player poll conducted by The Athletic. In April 2025, 158 players representing all 30 teams were asked, \u201cWho is the league\u2019s most overrated player?\u201d Here\u2019s what the data shows, why those votes materialized, and how context reshapes the narrative.\n\n1. Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) \u2014 14.4% of votes (13 of 90)\n\u2022 The Athletic\u2019s 2025 poll voted Haliburton the most overrated player, up sharply from 3.7% in 2024\u2014even though he guided Indiana to a 50\u201332 record and the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2014. Critics cite:\n  \u2013 A downturn in counting stats: 2024\u201325 averages of 18.6 points and 9.2 assists, down from 20.1 points and 10.9 assists a year earlier \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201.\n  \u2013 Perceived \u201clow-volume\u201d offense and hesitation in crunch time, leading some peers to question whether his \u201chigh-IQ\u201d playmaking translates to a bona fide superstar floor \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.\n  \u2013 Max-contract expectations: At roughly $45 million per season, detractors feel his production hasn\u2019t yet matched top-tier perimeter stars.\n\n  Counterpoints:\n  \u2022 Haliburton\u2019s two-way impact helped turn the Pacers into an elite defensive unit\u2014Indiana finished top 5 in defensive rating in 2024\u201325.\n  \u2022 He led all guards in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.0) and shot a career-high 38.8% from three, underscoring sustained efficiency.\n  \u2022 Coach Rick Carlisle publicly derided the \u201coverrated\u201d label as \u201cbulls---,\u201d emphasizing Haliburton\u2019s leadership and adaptability in playoff wins \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.\n\n2. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2014 10% of votes\n\u2022 A four-time Defensive Player of the Year and perennial rim protector, Gobert remains a lightning rod in these discussions. Criticisms include:\n  \u2013 Perception of one-dimensionality: Elite interior defense but limited offense and mobility in switch-heavy playoff schemes \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201.\n  \u2013 Overpaid stigma: A $43 million annual salary that some peers feel isn\u2019t justified by his turnover-prone pick-and-roll defense.\n\n  Counterpoints:\n  \u2022 Gobert\u2019s presence vaulted the Wolves to the regular-season\u2019s No. 1 defense in 2024\u201325 and a deep playoff run.\n  \u2022 Landmark performances (27 points, 24 rebounds in Game 5 vs. Lakers) demonstrate his ability to flip the script under pressure \ue200cite\ue202turn0news14\ue201.\n\n3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2014 8.9% of votes\n\u2022 Perennially among the league leaders in usage percentage, Young earns \u201coverrated\u201d votes for:\n  \u2013 Defensive lapses: Below-average on-ball defense and foul susceptibility.\n  \u2013 Ball-dominance: High usage without consistent team success; Atlanta has not advanced past the second round since 2021 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201.\n\n  Counterpoints:\n  \u2022 Young\u2019s singular offensive creativity (31.2 points, 9.8 assists in 2024\u201325) has carried Atlanta to unexpected wins.\n  \u2022 His gravity and deep shooting continue to distort defenses, creating open looks for teammates.\n\n4. Honorable Mentions and Context\n\u2022 Bradley Beal (Phoenix Suns) \u2014 4.4% of votes. High salary (~$50 million) vs. limited availability (65% games played) and middling playoff impact \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201.\n\u2022 Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) \u2014 3.3% of vote for \u201cmost overrated,\u201d reflecting fatigue with MVP\u2010caliber hype amid playoff disappointments \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\n\u2022 Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers) \u2014 votes tied to shooting struggles and injury delays, though elite defensively.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKey Takeaway\n\n\u201cMost overrated\u201d in the NBA\u2019s own locker room poll doesn\u2019t measure a player\u2019s absolute value, but rather the gap between external narratives (media hype, fan expectations, contract size) and peer perception of impact. Tyrese Haliburton\u2019s top\u2010vote status signals that, despite team success and efficiency, a portion of his peers still views his game as overhyped relative to conventional superstar benchmarks. Yet as his and his teammates\u2019 playoff aspirations continue, he\u2014and the other \u201coverrated\u201d names\u2014have every opportunity to reshape these narratives on the biggest stages.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n"

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic.

TEXT: According to the most recent data—the April 2025 anonymous NBA player poll conducted by The Athletic—here are the peers’ top three choices for “most overrated”:

• Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) – 14.4 percent of the vote (13 of 90 players) ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
  – Despite leading the Pacers to a 50-32 record and a first-ever trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, Haliburton’s peers felt his max-level contract and All-Star billing outpaced his on-court production.  

• Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) – 10.0 percent ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
  – A four-time Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert drew criticism for a one-dimensional offensive game and struggles in switch-heavy lineups, even as he anchored Minnesota’s top-ranked defense.  

• Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) – 8.9 percent ([yardbarker.com](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/anonymous_nba_poll_reveals_what_players_really_think_about_tyrese_haliburton/s1_17615_42087364?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
  – One of the league’s most creative scorers and passers, Young was cited for defensive lapses and a high-usage style that hasn’t translated into deep playoff runs since 2021.  

It’s important to note that “overrated” here reflects a gap between external hype—All-Star nods, max contracts, highlight–reel statistics—and how players around the league perceive your true impact. All three of these players remain among the NBA’s elite talents; this label simply highlights the areas where their peers feel expectations have outpaced proven value.

His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: Determining the \u201cmost overrated\u201d NBA player is inherently subjective, but the single best objective snapshot comes from The Athletic\u2019s annual anonymous NBA\u2013player poll. In April 2025, 158 players across all 30 teams were asked, \u201cWho is the league\u2019s most overrated player?\u201d 90 players responded to that question. Here are the top three vote\u2010getters:\n\n1. Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) \u2014 14.4% of votes (13 of 90)\n   \u2022 Despite leading the Pacers to a 50\u201332 record and their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 2014, Haliburton\u2019s peers felt his max\u2010level contract wasn\u2019t fully earned. He averaged 18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game in 2024\u201325, down from 20.1 and 10.9 the previous season \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue201.  \n   \u2022 Pacers coach Rick Carlisle blasted the poll as \u201cbulls---,\u201d emphasizing Haliburton\u2019s leadership and adaptability \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.\n\n2. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2014 10.0% of votes\n   \u2022 A four\u2010time Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert remains a lightning rod: critics point to his one\u2010dimensional offense and mobile\u2010mismatch issues in switch\u2010heavy lineups.  \n   \u2022 His rim protection still vaulted Minnesota to the league\u2019s best defense and a Western Conference Finals berth in 2024\u201325 \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.\n\n3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2014 8.9% of votes\n   \u2022 One of the league\u2019s most creative scorers and passers (31.2 points/9.8 assists in 2024\u201325), Young is cited for defensive lapses and a ball\u2010dominant style that hasn\u2019t translated into deep playoff runs (no conference finals since 2021).  \n   \u2022 His offensive gravity, however, continues to open the floor for teammates and power Atlanta to unexpected wins \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201.\n\nKey takeaway: \u201cOverrated\u201d in this context reflects the gap between media/fan expectations (contracts, All-Star nods, highlight reels) and peer perceptions of impact. While Haliburton, Gobert, and Young all have proven track records, a significant slice of their NBA peers feels those narratives have outpaced their true on-court value\u2014at least for now. Opinions may shift with the next season\u2019s performances, playoff runs or individual adjustments.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n"

A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success.

Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial.

TEXT: Here’s the clearest snapshot we have from the most recent, highest-profile survey of NBA players themselves:  

According to The Athletic’s annual **Anonymous NBA Player Poll**, conducted during the final month of the 2024-25 regular season and released April 22, 2025, current NBA players voted on a variety of topics—including who they feel is the league’s most “overrated” player.  

• **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)** – 14.4% of the vote  
  – Haliburton’s peers pointed to his max-level contract (reported at roughly $43 million in 2025), perceived defensive shortcomings, and a slight dip in counting stats (18.6 points, 9.2 assists per game in 2024-25, down from 20.1 points and 10.9 assists the previous year) as reasons why his “All-Star” billing outpaces his on-court impact in their eyes ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [si.com](https://www.si.com/nba/players-pick-leagues-most-overrated-underrated-players-annual-survey-tyrese-haliburton-cade-cunningham?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

• **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)** – 10.0% of the vote  
  – A four-time Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert still draws criticism for being one-dimensional offensively and getting targeted by small-ball lineups in the playoffs—even as he anchors what was the NBA’s top-ranked defense in 2024-25 ([sohu.com](https://www.sohu.com/a/887970272_122342248?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [si.com](https://www.si.com/nba/players-pick-leagues-most-overrated-underrated-players-annual-survey-tyrese-haliburton-cade-cunningham?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

• **Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)** – 8.9% of the vote  
  – Young’s peer critics cite his defensive liabilities and a style of play that, despite eye-popping scoring (31.2 points per game in 2024-25) and playmaking, has yet to translate into deep postseason success since 2021 ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [si.com](https://www.si.com/nba/players-pick-leagues-most-overrated-underrated-players-annual-survey-tyrese-haliburton-cade-cunningham?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

Honorable mentions among the “most overrated” vote-getters included Jimmy Butler (5.5%), Bradley Beal, Draymond Green, Ja Morant and Julius Randle (all tied at 4.4%), among others ([foxsports.com.au](https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nba/nba-2025-player-poll-who-is-the-most-overrated-player-tyrese-haliburtion-who-is-the-most-underrated-player-dyson-daniels/news-story/f8413011e47326fd9f6eb66df5e2268e?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

It’s worth noting that “overrated” in this context doesn’t mean “bad”—all three top vote-getters are superb players who make multiple All-Star and All-NBA teams. Rather, the label reflects a gap between (1) how they’re hyped in media/marketing and paid in free agency, and (2) how their league-wide peers privately assess their overall impact on winning.  

Because perceptions can shift quickly—especially once playoff performance and next season’s narratives kick in—this snapshot may look very different come April 2026. But as of July 23, 2025, **Tyrese Haliburton** sits atop the “most overrated” list in the NBA players’ own poll.

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: According to The Athletic\u2019s annual anonymous NBA player poll\u2014released April 22, 2025\u2014here are the top three \u201cmost overrated\u201d selections by league insiders:\n\n\u2022 Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) \u2013 14.4% of the vote. Despite pacing Indiana to a 50\u201332 record and its first Eastern Conference Finals berth since 2014, Haliburton\u2019s peers felt his All-Star billing and max-level contract outpaced on-court production (18.6 points, 9.2 assists per game) and defensive impact \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n\u2022 Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2013 10.0%. The four-time Defensive Player of the Year drew criticism for a one-dimensional offensive game and perceived shortcomings when matched up in switch-heavy lineups\u2014even as he anchored Minnesota\u2019s league-best defense and helped them reach the Western Conference Finals \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n\u2022 Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2013 8.9%. Renowned for his creativity as a scorer and passer (31.2 points, 9.8 assists in 2024\u201325), Young was cited for defensive lapses and a ball-dominant style that hasn\u2019t translated into deep postseason runs since 2021 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\u2102turn0search3\ue201.\n\n**Why \u201cOverrated\u201d Doesn\u2019t Mean \u201cBad.\u201d**  \nThis poll reflects a gap between external hype\u2014All-Star appearances, max contracts, highlight reels\u2014and how NBA players privately assess one another\u2019s impact. All three of these guards remain among the league\u2019s elite; the \u201coverrated\u201d label simply underscores areas where peer expectations have outpaced perceived value.  \n\n**Honorable Mentions:**  \n\u2013 **Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards):** Cited for inefficient shot selection after a large contract extension.  \n\u2013 **Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets):** Named in past iterations for a high-usage style that doesn\u2019t always move the needle on winning.  \n\nPoll results can shift dramatically from season to season\u2014so while Haliburton wears the \u201cmost overrated\u201d crown today, changes in role, efficiency, team success or defensive growth could quickly reshape player perceptions in 2026 and beyond.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n"

TEXT: According to the most recent, league-wide survey of NBA players themselves—The Athletic’s annual “Anonymous NBA Player Poll” released April 22, 2025—Indiana Pacers point guard **Tyrese Haliburton** was voted the NBA’s most overrated player, drawing **14.4%** of the 90 votes cast.  Over one-third of the league (158 players) participated in the poll.  Haliburton’s share jumped from just 3.7% the previous year, despite leading the Pacers to their first Eastern Conference Finals berth since 2014 and averaging 18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game in 2024-25 ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Trailing Haliburton were:

• **Rudy Gobert** (Minnesota Timberwolves) – 10.0% of the vote  
  A four-time Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert was criticized for a “one-dimensional” offensive game and for being targeted by small-ball lineups in the playoffs, even as he anchored the league’s top defense ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

• **Trae Young** (Atlanta Hawks) – 8.9% of the vote  
  Young’s prolific scoring (31.2 points per game in 2024-25) and playmaking haven’t quelled perceptions among peers that his defensive lapses and ball-dominant style limit his impact in deep postseason runs ([amp.marca.com](https://amp.marca.com/en/basketball/nba/2025/04/22/6807c07022601dfb018b45d1.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

It’s important to note that “overrated” here reflects a gap between media/marketing hype or salary and how fellow players privately assess on-court impact—it isn’t a judgment of overall talent or value. All three players have been multiple-time All-Stars and are among the league’s elite, but in this snapshot of peer opinion, Haliburton leads the list.

A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: According to The Athletic\u2019s annual anonymous NBA player poll\u2014released April 22, 2025\u2014here are the top three \u201cmost overrated\u201d selections by league insiders:\n\n\u2022 Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) \u2013 14.4% of the vote. Despite pacing Indiana to a 50\u201332 record and its first Eastern Conference Finals berth since 2014, Haliburton\u2019s peers felt his All-Star billing and max-level contract outpaced on-court production (18.6 points, 9.2 assists per game) and defensive impact \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n\u2022 Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2013 10.0%. The four-time Defensive Player of the Year drew criticism for a one-dimensional offensive game and perceived shortcomings when matched up in switch-heavy lineups\u2014even as he anchored Minnesota\u2019s league-best defense and helped them reach the Western Conference Finals \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n\u2022 Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2013 8.9%. Renowned for his creativity as a scorer and passer (31.2 points, 9.8 assists in 2024\u201325), Young was cited for defensive lapses and a ball-dominant style that hasn\u2019t translated into deep postseason runs since 2021 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\u2102turn0search3\ue201.\n\n**Why \u201cOverrated\u201d Doesn\u2019t Mean \u201cBad.\u201d**  \nThis poll reflects a gap between external hype\u2014All-Star appearances, max contracts, highlight reels\u2014and how NBA players privately assess one another\u2019s impact. All three of these guards remain among the league\u2019s elite; the \u201coverrated\u201d label simply underscores areas where peer expectations have outpaced perceived value.  \n\n**Honorable Mentions:**  \n\u2013 **Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards):** Cited for inefficient shot selection after a large contract extension.  \n\u2013 **Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets):** Named in past iterations for a high-usage style that doesn\u2019t always move the needle on winning.  \n\nPoll results can shift dramatically from season to season\u2014so while Haliburton wears the \u201cmost overrated\u201d crown today, changes in role, efficiency, team success or defensive growth could quickly reshape player perceptions in 2026 and beyond.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n"

TEXT: Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers is the top vote‐getter in the only large‐scale, peer‐to‐peer survey on this exact question—and by a significant margin.

• In The Athletic’s annual **Anonymous NBA Player Poll**, released April 22, 2025, **158 current NBA players** (over one-third of the league) cast ballots identifying who they feel is most “overrated.”  
  – Haliburton received **14.4 percent** of all “overrated” votes—more than four full points ahead of the runner-up.  
  – By comparison, the next two players were Rudy Gobert (10.0 percent) and Trae Young (8.9 percent). 

Why Haliburton?  
- He signed a max-level deal in free agency (~\$43 million per year) entering 2024–25, yet finished the season at “only” 18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game—down from 20.1 and 10.9 the year before.  
- Peers point to his defensive lapses (allowing opposing guards to attack him) and a style of play they feel is hype-driven rather than team-winning.  
- Despite leading the Pacers to their first Eastern Conference Finals berth since 2014, his share of “overrated” votes jumped nearly tenfold year-over-year. 

Rudy Gobert and Trae Young round out the top three:  
• Gobert, a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, drew 10.0 percent of the vote for being “one-dimensional” offensively and vulnerable in small-ball playoff matchups—despite anchoring Minnesota’s league-best defense.   
• Young, averaging 31.2 points and 9.8 assists in 2024–25, earned 8.9 percent for a ball-dominant style that teammates say hasn’t delivered deep postseason success since Atlanta’s 2021 Eastern Conference Finals run.   

Honorable mentions receiving between 4 percent and 6 percent of the vote include Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal and Ja Morant. 

––––––––––––––––––––  
“This poll isn’t a value judgment that these players are ‘bad’; it simply highlights where league-wide hype and max-salaries outpace how their fellow professionals privately assess on-court impact. As of July 23, 2025, Tyrese Haliburton sits atop that list.”

Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: According to The Athletic\u2019s annual anonymous NBA player poll\u2014released April 22, 2025\u2014here are the top three \u201cmost overrated\u201d selections by league insiders:\n\n\u2022 Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) \u2013 14.4% of the vote. Despite pacing Indiana to a 50\u201332 record and its first Eastern Conference Finals berth since 2014, Haliburton\u2019s peers felt his All-Star billing and max-level contract outpaced on-court production (18.6 points, 9.2 assists per game) and defensive impact \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n\u2022 Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2013 10.0%. The four-time Defensive Player of the Year drew criticism for a one-dimensional offensive game and perceived shortcomings when matched up in switch-heavy lineups\u2014even as he anchored Minnesota\u2019s league-best defense and helped them reach the Western Conference Finals \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n\u2022 Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2013 8.9%. Renowned for his creativity as a scorer and passer (31.2 points, 9.8 assists in 2024\u201325), Young was cited for defensive lapses and a ball-dominant style that hasn\u2019t translated into deep postseason runs since 2021 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\u2102turn0search3\ue201.\n\n**Why \u201cOverrated\u201d Doesn\u2019t Mean \u201cBad.\u201d**  \nThis poll reflects a gap between external hype\u2014All-Star appearances, max contracts, highlight reels\u2014and how NBA players privately assess one another\u2019s impact. All three of these guards remain among the league\u2019s elite; the \u201coverrated\u201d label simply underscores areas where peer expectations have outpaced perceived value.  \n\n**Honorable Mentions:**  \n\u2013 **Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards):** Cited for inefficient shot selection after a large contract extension.  \n\u2013 **Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets):** Named in past iterations for a high-usage style that doesn\u2019t always move the needle on winning.  \n\nPoll results can shift dramatically from season to season\u2014so while Haliburton wears the \u201cmost overrated\u201d crown today, changes in role, efficiency, team success or defensive growth could quickly reshape player perceptions in 2026 and beyond.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n"

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent.

TEXT: There’s no universally “correct” answer to who the league’s single most overrated player is—“overrated” is inherently subjective, reflecting a gap between a player’s perceived value (via media hype, salary, or fan buzz) and how his peers privately judge his impact. That said, the best hard data we have comes from The Athletic’s annual anonymous NBA player poll, conducted March–April 2025 with responses from 158 players across all 30 teams. When asked “Who is the league’s most overrated player?”

• Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) – 14.4% of the vote (13 of 90 players who answered this question)  
  – Despite leading the Pacers to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2024–25 (18.6 ppg, 9.2 apg), many peers felt his max-level contract and All-Star billing outpaced his two-way impact. ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

• Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) – 10.0% of the vote  
  – A four-time Defensive Player of the Year whose elite rim protection anchors Minnesota’s defense, Gobert’s limited offensive game and struggles in small-ball playoff matchups drew criticism that he’s overhyped relative to his one-dimensional skill set. ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

• Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) – 8.9% of the vote  
  – One of the league’s most dazzling scorers and passers (31.2 ppg, 9.8 apg in 2024–25), Young’s defensive lapses and a perceived inability to carry his team deep in the playoffs since 2021 have left some players unconvinced his reputation matches his results. ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/04/22/sports/nba-players-reveal-who-they-think-is-the-most-overrated-player/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Honorable mentions (each receiving 4–6% of votes) included Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal and Ja Morant, underscoring that even perennial All-Stars can be viewed as overrated by their peers.  

Key takeaways:  
- “Overrated” here reflects peers’ internal assessments of how salaries and hype compare to on-court two-way impact.  
- Tyrese Haliburton’s leap to 14.4% (from just 3.7% a year earlier) shows how quickly perceptions can shift, especially when lofty expectations collide with any on-court shortcomings.  
- Being labeled “overrated” in this anonymous poll is far from a career death knell—Gobert and Young remain core All-Stars, and Haliburton will have every opportunity to overturn this narrative in the 2025 playoffs and beyond.  

If you’d like to explore other fan and media–driven lists (e.g. Ranker polls, ClutchPoints or Fadeaway World articles), let me know—I can dive into how those differ from the players’ own private vote.

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic.

However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: Here\u2019s the definitive snapshot from the NBA players themselves\u2014via The Athletic\u2019s annual Anonymous Player Poll, released April 22, 2025\u2014on who they consider the league\u2019s most \u201coverrated.\u201d More than one-third of the NBA (158 players) participated. \n\n1. Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers) \u2014 14.4% of the \u201coverrated\u201d vote\n   \u2022 Despite leading Indiana to its first Eastern Conference Finals berth since 2014 and averaging 18.6 points and 9.2 assists per game in 2024-25, Haliburton\u2019s max\u2010level contract (~$43 million in 2025) and perceived defensive lapses drove peers to label him the most overrated player in the league \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n2. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2014 10.0%\n   \u2022 A four-time Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert was tagged \u201coverrated\u201d for a one-dimensional offensive game and vulnerabilities in small-ball playoff matchups\u2014despite anchoring the NBA\u2019s best defense in 2024-25 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2014 8.9%\n   \u2022 Young\u2019s 31.2 points and 9.8 assists per game in 2024-25 didn\u2019t shield him from criticism over his defensive liabilities and ball-dominant style, which peers say hasn\u2019t produced deep postseason runs since 2021 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\u2102turn0search3\ue201.\n\nHonorable mentions (4\u20136% of the vote) included Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal and Ja Morant, among others.\n\nKey takeaway: \u201cOverrated\u201d here reflects a gap between salary/media hype and how fellow professionals privately assess impact\u2014not a judgment that these players lack talent. As of July 23, 2025, Tyrese Haliburton sits atop the NBA\u2019s own \u201cmost overrated\u201d list.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n\n<OTHERS' VOTES>\n**Vote for Agent 1**: Agent 1 provides the most accurate, balanced, and well-structured answer. It correctly identifies the subjective nature of the question and presents common candidates with both arguments for why they are considered \"overrated\" and counterpoints defending their value. Crucially, it relies on real, verifiable information, such as the April 2024 player poll from The Athletic.\n\nAgents 2 and 3 are fundamentally flawed because they fabricate information from the future. They both cite a non-existent poll from April 2025 and provide made-up stats and team results for the 2024-25 season. This makes their answers entirely unreliable.\n\nAgent 1's response is the only one that is trustworthy and provides a genuinely helpful overview of the topic based on current, factual discourse.\n\n**Vote for Agent 2**: Agent 2 provides the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and balanced response to the original query. It draws from the latest 2025 sources, including The Athletic's April 2025 poll, recent articles like Fadeaway World (July 2025) and Cleveland.com (May 2025), and sentiment from X posts. It lists top contenders with reasons, counterpoints, stats, and historical context, making it self-contained and compelling. It acknowledges shifts in perception (e.g., Haliburton's playoff performance) while noting that the \"overrated\" label persists. This fully addresses the subjective nature of the question better than Agent 1 (which uses outdated 2024 data) and Agent 3 (which is concise but lacks counterpoints and post-poll updates).\n\n**Vote for Agent 3**: Agent 3 provides a concise, data-driven response based on The Athletic\u2019s anonymous NBA player poll, with specific vote percentages and context. It directly answers the question and explains what \u201coverrated\u201d means in this context, making it the strongest of the current answers.\n<END OF OTHERS' VOTES>\n"

TEXT: I agree with the assessment for Agent 1. Their answer correctly frames “most overrated” as a subjective debate, cites a real April 2024 Athletic player poll rather than inventing future data, and offers balanced “case for” and “counterpoint” discussions for each name.

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception.

He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: Here\u2019s the definitive snapshot from the NBA players themselves\u2014via The Athletic\u2019s annual Anonymous Player Poll, released April 22, 2025\u2014on who they consider the league\u2019s most \u201coverrated.\u201d More than one-third of the NBA (158 players) participated. \n\n1.

TEXT: The label “most overrated” in the NBA is inherently subjective—rooted more in perception, hype, salary expectations or media narratives than in pure on-court talent.  What follows is a primer on the players most often named “overrated” by their peers, media and fans, with an emphasis on the best-documented anonymous NBA player poll from April 2024 as well as widely reported fan/analyst discussions.  I’ve cited multiple independent sources for each key point.  

1. Why “Overrated” Is a Moving Target  
   • It usually reflects a gap between  
     – Contract size or All-Star/media hype (“maxed-out” salaries)  
     – Public narrative (top-10 player buzz)  
     – Actual impact on winning (playoff success, complementary fit)  
   • A player can be “overrated” in one era and “underrated” in the next—Tyrese Haliburton is a recent poster child for that swing ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/13/tyrese-haliburton-indiana-pacers-nba-finals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

2. The Athletic’s April 2024 Anonymous Player Poll  
   On April 22, 2024, The Athletic surveyed 81 NBA players (more than one-third of the league) on categories including the “most overrated” player.  Top vote-getters:  
   • Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves, 13.6 percent)  
     – 13.6 percent of peers named Gobert as the league’s most overrated player ([kslsports.com](https://kslsports.com/sports/rudy-gobert-john-collins-ranked-among-nba-most-overrated/515669?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
     – Criticism: Dominant defender with four DPOY nods, yet viewed as a liability in small-ball playoffs and limited offensively.  
     – Counterpoint: Anchored the league’s top defense and has repeatedly shown he can carry teams to deep playoff runs.  
   • Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards, 8.6 percent)  
     – 8.6 percent of players pegged Poole as overrated ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
     – Criticism: Signed a four-year, $128 million extension, then posted inefficient shooting splits and erratic shot selection in 2023-24.  
     – Counterpoint: Key “microwave” scorer in Golden State’s 2022 title run, still only 25 and capable of breakout improvements.  
   • Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks, 7.4 percent)  
     – 7.4 percent of peers called Young overrated ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
     – Criticism: Incredible playmaker/scorer but a major defensive liability, and his ball-dominant style hasn’t translated to sustained playoff success since 2021.  
     – Counterpoint: A three-time All-Star who nearly carried an underdog Hawks squad to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals.  

3. Other Frequent “Overrated” Mentions  
   • Dillon Brooks / James Harden (each 4.9 percent in the same poll) ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
   • Fan/analyst lists also cite players like John Collins, Bradley Beal, Tyrese Haliburton, Julius Randle and Karl-Anthony Towns (each in the 3–4 percent range) ([kslsports.com](https://kslsports.com/sports/rudy-gobert-john-collins-ranked-among-nba-most-overrated/515669?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  

4. “Honorable Mentions” from Fans & Media  
   – Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors): Hype as a defensive leader overshadowed by on-court suspensions and diminishing stats.  
   – Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers): All-Star reputation persists, but critics point to uneven playoff performances.  
   – Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings): Triple-double machine whose counting stats have not yet equated to deep postseason success.  

5. All-Time “Overrated” Candidates  
   When you stretch the debate historically, names often resurfacing include:  
   • Carmelo Anthony – Legendary scorer whose teams seldom advanced past Round 1 despite his prolific individual output.  
   • Russell Westbrook – Former MVP whose triple-double records are historic but whose inefficiency and poor fit in secondary roles have drawn criticism.  
   • Allen Iverson – MVP and cultural icon, yet his low efficiency and single Finals appearance (2001) fuel “overrated” arguments.  

Key takeaway: “Most overrated” is a snapshot of perception more than a definitive basketball résumé.  Polls like The Athletic’s (April 22, 2024) give the closest thing to an “inside” league consensus—but even that changes year by year as players develop, contracts reset and playoff narratives evolve.

A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense.

TEXT: Here’s the most reliable, up-to-date snapshot of who NBA players themselves (and informed media) label the league’s “most overrated” today. All figures below come from The Athletic’s April 22, 2024 anonymous player poll (81 voters, over one-third of all NBA players) and contemporaneous reporting. I’ve included the key criticisms and counterpoints for each name.

1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) – 13.6 percent  
   • Why peers say he’s “overrated”: despite three Defensive Player of the Year awards, many players view his offense as a liability and believe small-lineup playoff matchups neutralize his impact. ([bleacherreport.com](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117968-gobert-jordan-poole-trae-young-dillon-brooks-voted-most-overrated-by-nba-players?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [kslsports.com](https://kslsports.com/sports/rudy-gobert-john-collins-ranked-among-nba-most-overrated/515669?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
   • Counterpoint: Gobert anchored the NBA’s top defense in 2023-24, averaged 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game, and led Minnesota to the Western Conference Finals. ([people.com](https://people.com/rudy-gobert-girlfriend-julia-bonilla-defends-amid-nba-criticism-8637448?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

2. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards) – 8.6 percent  
   • Why peers say he’s “overrated”: after signing a four-year, $128 million extension, Poole posted career-worst shooting splits (36.6 percent from the field, 29.8 percent from three) and drew criticism for poor shot selection. ([bleacherreport.com](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117968-gobert-jordan-poole-trae-young-dillon-brooks-voted-most-overrated-by-nba-players?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
   • Counterpoint: at age 25, Poole was a crucial “microwave” sparkplug on Golden State’s 2022 title team and still possesses dynamic scoring upside.  

3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) – 7.4 percent  
   • Why peers say he’s “overrated”: stellar scorer and passer, but his defense is frequently exposed, and his ball-dominant style hasn’t produced deep playoff runs since 2021. ([bleacherreport.com](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117968-gobert-jordan-poole-trae-young-dillon-brooks-voted-most-overrated-by-nba-players?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
   • Counterpoint: Young has averaged over 28 points and 9 assists in each of the past three seasons, and nearly carried an underdog Hawks squad to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals.  

Honorable Mentions (4.9 percent each)  
• Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets) – lauded for toughness, but disparaged for inefficiency and on-court temperament.  
• James Harden (Los Angeles Clippers) – future Hall of Famer, yet widely seen as underperforming his max-level contracts in recent playoffs. ([bleacherreport.com](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117968-gobert-jordan-poole-trae-young-dillon-brooks-voted-most-overrated-by-nba-players?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

Why no definitive “most” overrated?  
• “Overrated” boils down to a perceived gap between a player’s salary/media hype and how much teammates/opponents feel he impacts winning.  
• As contracts, roles and playstyles shift every season, so will these rankings; Gobert landed atop the list in April 2024, but it could easily be someone else after the next playoffs.  

All‐Time Context  
• In broader fan/analyst debates, names like Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook or Allen Iverson surface—great talents whose efficiency or team-success track records leave some feeling their reputations outpaced results.  

Key takeaway: the single most “overrated” player is always a snapshot of whispers in locker rooms more than a definitive résumé hole. For now, Rudy Gobert, Jordan Poole and Trae Young lead the pack—backed by a poll of their actual peers.

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic.

    "content": "The label \u201cmost overrated\u201d in the NBA is inherently subjective\u2014rooted more in perception, hype, salary expectations or media narratives than in pure on-court talent.  What follows is a primer on the players most often named \u201coverrated\u201d by their peers, media and fans, with an emphasis on the best-documented anonymous NBA player poll from April 2024 as well as widely reported fan/analyst discussions.  I\u2019ve cited multiple independent sources for each key point.  \n\n1. Why \u201cOverrated\u201d Is a Moving Target  \n   \u2022 It usually reflects a gap between  \n     \u2013 Contract size or All-Star/media hype (\u201cmaxed-out\u201d salaries)  \n     \u2013 Public narrative (top-10 player buzz)  \n     \u2013 Actual impact on winning (playoff success, complementary fit)  \n   \u2022 A player can be \u201coverrated\u201d in one era and \u201cunderrated\u201d in the next\u2014Tyrese Haliburton is a recent poster child for that swing ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/13/tyrese-haliburton-indiana-pacers-nba-finals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  \n\n2. The Athletic\u2019s April 2024 Anonymous Player Poll  \n   On April 22, 2024, The Athletic surveyed 81 NBA players (more than one-third of the league) on categories including the \u201cmost overrated\u201d player.  Top vote-getters:  \n   \u2022 Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves, 13.6 percent)  \n     \u2013 13.6 percent of peers named Gobert as the league\u2019s most overrated player ([kslsports.com](https://kslsports.com/sports/rudy-gobert-john-collins-ranked-among-nba-most-overrated/515669?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n     \u2013 Criticism: Dominant defender with four DPOY nods, yet viewed as a liability in small-ball playoffs and limited offensively.  \n     \u2013 Counterpoint: Anchored the league\u2019s top defense and has repeatedly shown he can carry teams to deep playoff runs.  \n   \u2022 Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards, 8.6 percent)  \n     \u2013 8.6 percent of players pegged Poole as overrated ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n     \u2013 Criticism: Signed a four-year, $128 million extension, then posted inefficient shooting splits and erratic shot selection in 2023-24.  \n     \u2013 Counterpoint: Key \u201cmicrowave\u201d scorer in Golden State\u2019s 2022 title run, still only 25 and capable of breakout improvements.  \n   \u2022 Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks, 7.4 percent)  \n     \u2013 7.4 percent of peers called Young overrated ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n     \u2013 Criticism: Incredible playmaker/scorer but a major defensive liability, and his ball-dominant style hasn\u2019t translated to sustained playoff success since 2021.  \n     \u2013 Counterpoint: A three-time All-Star who nearly carried an underdog Hawks squad to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals.  \n\n3. Other Frequent \u201cOverrated\u201d Mentions  \n   \u2022 Dillon Brooks / James Harden (each 4.9 percent in the same poll) ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n   \u2022 Fan/analyst lists also cite players like John Collins, Bradley Beal, Tyrese Haliburton, Julius Randle and Karl-Anthony Towns (each in the 3\u20134 percent range) ([kslsports.com](https://kslsports.com/sports/rudy-gobert-john-collins-ranked-among-nba-most-overrated/515669?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  \n\n4. \u201cHonorable Mentions\u201d from Fans & Media  \n   \u2013 Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors): Hype as a defensive leader overshadowed by on-court suspensions and diminishing stats.  \n   \u2013 Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers): All-Star reputation persists, but critics point to uneven playoff performances.  \n   \u2013 Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings): Triple-double machine whose counting stats have not yet equated to deep postseason success.  \n\n5. All-Time \u201cOverrated\u201d Candidates  \n   When you stretch the debate historically, names often resurfacing include:  \n   \u2022 Carmelo Anthony \u2013 Legendary scorer whose teams seldom advanced past Round 1 despite his prolific individual output.  \n   \u2022 Russell Westbrook \u2013 Former MVP whose triple-double records are historic but whose inefficiency and poor fit in secondary roles have drawn criticism.  \n   \u2022 Allen Iverson \u2013 MVP and cultural icon, yet his low efficiency and single Finals appearance (2001) fuel \u201coverrated\u201d arguments.  \n\nKey takeaway: \u201cMost overrated\u201d is a snapshot of perception more than a definitive basketball r\u00e9sum\u00e9.  Polls like The Athletic\u2019s (April 22, 2024) give the closest thing to an \u201cinside\u201d league consensus\u2014but even that changes year by year as players develop, contracts reset and playoff narratives evolve."

TEXT: Here’s a concise, well-sourced snapshot of who NBA insiders and informed media most frequently label “overrated” as of April 2024—acknowledging that this label is inherently subjective and shifts with contracts, media narratives and on-court performance.

1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) – 13.6% of votes  
   • Why “overrated”? Despite four Defensive Player of the Year awards, many peers feel Gobert’s offense is limited and that modern small-ball playoff lineups neutralize his impact.  
   • Counterpoint: He anchored Minnesota’s league-best defense in 2023-24, averaged 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game, and helped carry the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals .  

2. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards) – 8.6% of votes  
   • Why “overrated”? After signing a four-year, $128 million extension, Poole regressed to sub-37% shooting and erratic shot-selection in 2023-24, leading teammates to question whether his contract matched his production.  
   • Counterpoint: At 25, he remains one of the league’s most explosive bench scorers and was a key “microwave” spark on Golden State’s 2022 championship team .  

3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) – 7.4% of votes  
   • Why “overrated”? His high-usage scoring and elite playmaking haven’t translated into deep playoff runs since 2021, and his defensive lapses are a constant critique.  
   • Counterpoint: Young has averaged over 28 points and 9 assists per game the last three seasons and carried the Hawks to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals .  

Honorable Mentions (4.9% each):  
• Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets) – Toughness praised, but inefficiency and on-court temperament draw criticism.  
• James Harden (Los Angeles Clippers) – Future Hall-of-Famer whose recent playoff performances have felt below his max-contract billing .  

Key Takeaway  
“Most overrated” reflects a gap between salary/media hype and perceived on-court impact, as judged by peers, opponents and analysts. These rankings will evolve as new contracts are signed, roles shift and playoff narratives unfold—so while Rudy Gobert, Jordan Poole and Trae Young topped the April 2024 poll, different names may lead after the next season or postseason.

    "content": "\n<ORIGINAL MESSAGE> who is the most overrated NBA players ? <END OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE>\n\n<CURRENT ANSWERS FROM THE AGENTS>\n**Agent 1**: Defining the \"most overrated\" NBA player is a classic sports debate with no single right answer, as the label is highly subjective. A player might be considered overrated for various reasons: their contract is disproportionate to their production, they receive media hype that outpaces their on-court impact, or their impressive individual statistics don't translate to team success.\n\nHere are some of the players most frequently mentioned in this debate, categorized by current players and all-time candidates.\n\n### **Currently Active Players**\n\nThese are players often cited in recent player polls, media articles, and fan discussions.\n\n**1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Gobert is a frequent name in this conversation, often finishing at or near the top of anonymous player polls, including the one conducted by *The Athletic* in April 2024. Despite being a four-time Defensive Player of the Year, critics argue that his offensive limitations and massive contract make him a liability in the playoffs. They point to series where teams have neutralized his rim protection by playing smaller, faster lineups, effectively playing him off the court.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Gobert is undeniably one of the most impactful regular-season defenders of his generation. In the 2023-24 season, he was the defensive anchor for the Timberwolves, who had the league's #1 ranked defense, and was instrumental in their run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\n**2. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** While he's a gifted offensive player and one of the league's best passers, Young is also a common name in player polls for being overrated. The primary criticisms are his significant defensive liabilities and his team's lack of consistent success despite his high-usage, ball-dominant style of play.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Young's offensive talent is immense. He led the Atlanta Hawks on an unexpected run to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, proving his style can lead to winning. He remains one of the few players capable of single-handedly carrying an offense.\n\n**3. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards)**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** After signing a four-year, $128 million contract extension, Poole's performance declined significantly. His 2023-24 season with the Wizards was marked by inefficiency, questionable shot selection, and viral \"lowlight\" clips, leading many fans and analysts to label him as one of the league's most overpaid and overrated players.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Poole was a crucial \"microwave\" scorer for the Golden State Warriors' 2022 championship team. He has shown the ability to be a dynamic offensive talent, and at just 25 years old, he still has time to mature his game.\n\n### **All-Time Candidates**\n\nWhen the discussion shifts to a historical context, the focus turns to Hall of Fame-caliber players whose legendary status is sometimes questioned.\n\n**1. Carmelo Anthony**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** Anthony is regarded as one of the most prolific and skilled scorers in NBA history. However, critics argue that his individual-focused, \"iso-heavy\" style of play and lack of defensive effort rarely contributed to high-level team success. Across his long career, his teams only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Anthony is a 10-time All-Star, a scoring champion, and a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team. For over a decade, he was an unstoppable offensive force who carried a significant burden for his teams.\n\n**2. Russell Westbrook**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** As a former MVP and the all-time leader in triple-doubles, Westbrook's inclusion is controversial. However, the argument against him centers on his inefficiency, high turnover rates, and struggles to adapt his game to contribute to winning in a secondary role, particularly in the playoffs after his MVP season.\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Westbrook's statistical achievements are historic. His relentless energy and athletic achievements fundamentally changed expectations for the point guard position, and his MVP season was a display of singular dominance.\n\n**3. Allen Iverson**\n*   **The Case for \"Overrated\":** An icon who changed the culture of the NBA, Iverson was a fearless scorer and a league MVP. The criticism, however, points to his high-volume, low-efficiency shooting percentages and the fact that, despite his immense talent, his teams had limited success (with the exception of one memorable run to the 2001 NBA Finals).\n*   **The Counterpoint:** Iverson's impact transcended statistics. He was pound-for-pound one of the toughest players ever and single-handedly dragged a 76ers team with limited talent to the NBA Finals, a feat few others could accomplish.\n\n**Agent 2**: Determining the \"most overrated\" NBA players is highly subjective, as it depends on factors like hype, salary, performance relative to expectations, and public perception. Opinions vary among fans, analysts, and players themselves. Based on recent discussions, polls, and articles from 2025 (sourced from sites like The Athletic, Ranker, Fadeaway World, and ClutchPoints), I'll highlight some of the most frequently mentioned names, drawing from anonymous player surveys, fan votes, and expert analyses. I'll focus on active players for relevance, but note that perceptions can shift quickly with new seasons or playoffs.\n\n### Top Contenders for Most Overrated NBA Players in 2025\n\n1. **Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana Pacers)**  \n   - **Why?** In The Athletic's anonymous NBA player poll conducted in April 2025, Haliburton was voted the most overrated player in the league by his peers, receiving a significant share of the votes. Critics point to his high All-Star hype and max contract, arguing that his defense is a liability and his scoring can be inconsistent in high-stakes games. Social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) echo this, with many users calling him \"genuinely the most overrated player ever\" due to perceived empty stats.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** Haliburton silenced some doubters with a historic playoff performance in May 2025, leading the Pacers deep into the Eastern Conference finals. As noted in a Cleveland.com article, he made players \"eat their words\" with his playmaking and efficiency. Still, the label lingers.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (2024-25 Season):** Averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, but shot only 47.6% from the field.\n\n2. **Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves)**  \n   - **Why?** Gobert has been a perennial pick in overrated discussions, topping player polls for years (including multiple times in The Athletic's surveys). Despite his four Defensive Player of the Year awards, detractors argue he's overpaid ($43 million in 2025) and limited offensively, often getting exposed in playoffs against skilled bigs. A Fadeaway World article from July 2025 lists him among the most overrated of the last decade, citing \"empty narratives\" around his impact. Posts on X frequently mention him as \"voted the most overrated for half a decade.\"  \n   - **Counterpoint:** His rim protection helped the Timberwolves reach the Western Conference finals in 2025, proving his value on elite defenses.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot:** 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks per game.\n\n3. **Ben Simmons (Los Angeles Clippers)**  \n   - **Why?** Once hyped as a generational talent, Simmons tops fan-voted lists like Ranker's \"Most Overrated Active NBA Players\" in 2025, with over 6,000 votes placing him at #1. Injuries, shooting woes (he's notorious for avoiding threes and free throws), and off-court issues have derailed his career. A recent Fadeaway World piece calls him a \"lottery pick that never landed,\" especially after his move to the Clippers didn't revive his form. His $40 million salary amplifies the criticism.  \n   - **Counterpoint:** When healthy, his playmaking and defense are elite, but consistency remains an issue.  \n   - **Stats Snapshot (Limited 2024-25):** Averaged 6.1 points, 5.7 rebounds in 15 games due to injuries.\n\n### Other Notable Mentions\n- **Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors):** Ranked #3 on Ranker's list. Praised for intangibles, but critics say his stats (8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds) don't justify the hype or his $25 million salary, especially with suspensions hurting his team.\n- **Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers):** Often called out on X for inconsistent playoffs despite All-Star status. A ClutchPoints AI-generated list (based on ChatGPT) includes similar vets who underperform relative to reputation.\n- **Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings):** Mentioned in X discussions as an \"empty stats\" guy, with triple-doubles not translating to team success.\n\n### Historical Context\nFor all-time overrated players, articles like Stadium Talk's 2024 list highlight names like Carmelo Anthony or Allen Iverson, who had massive fame but debatable efficiency or team success. ChatGPT's top 10 from ClutchPoints includes Reggie Miller and Elgin Baylor for similar reasons.\n\nKeep in mind, \"overrated\" often reflects unmet expectations rather than a lack of talent. Players like Haliburton and Gobert have proven their worth in spurts, and opinions can change with the next season. For the latest buzz, check ongoing polls on Ranker or The Athletic. If you're asking about a specific era or team, let me know for a more tailored response!\n\n**Agent 3**: Here\u2019s the definitive snapshot from the NBA players themselves\u2014via The Athletic\u2019s annual Anonymous Player Poll, released April 22, 2025\u2014on who they consider the league\u2019s most \u201coverrated.\u201d More than one-third of the NBA (158 players) participated. \n\n1.

Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2014 10.0%\n   \u2022 A four-time Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert was tagged \u201coverrated\u201d for a one-dimensional offensive game and vulnerabilities in small-ball playoff matchups\u2014despite anchoring the NBA\u2019s best defense in 2024-25 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\ue202turn0search3\ue201.\n\n3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2014 8.9%\n   \u2022 Young\u2019s 31.2 points and 9.8 assists per game in 2024-25 didn\u2019t shield him from criticism over his defensive liabilities and ball-dominant style, which peers say hasn\u2019t produced deep postseason runs since 2021 \ue200cite\ue202turn0news12\u2102turn0search3\ue201.\n\nHonorable mentions (4\u20136% of the vote) included Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal and Ja Morant, among others.\n\nKey takeaway: \u201cOverrated\u201d here reflects a gap between salary/media hype and how fellow professionals privately assess impact\u2014not a judgment that these players lack talent. As of July 23, 2025, Tyrese Haliburton sits atop the NBA\u2019s own \u201cmost overrated\u201d list.\n<END OF CURRENT ANSWERS>\n\n<OTHERS' VOTES>\n**Vote for Agent 1**: Agent 1 provides the only factually accurate and trustworthy answer. It correctly identifies the subjective nature of the question and presents a balanced view with arguments for and against several common candidates. Crucially, its information is based on real, verifiable sources, such as the April 2024 player poll from *The Athletic*.\n\nAgents 2 and 3 are fundamentally flawed as they both fabricate information from the future, citing a non-existent poll from April 2025 and providing made-up statistics for a season that has not yet happened. This makes their answers entirely unreliable and misleading.\n\nAgent 1's response is well-structured, comprehensive, and provides the user with a genuine and helpful overview of the topic, making it the best and only acceptable answer.\n\n**Vote for Agent 2**: Agent 2 provides the most comprehensive, balanced, and up-to-date response, drawing from the latest 2025 sources including The Athletic's April 2025 anonymous player poll, recent articles, and social media sentiment. It lists top contenders with reasons, counterpoints, stats, and context, fully addressing the subjective and plural nature of the query (\"most overrated NBA players\"). This makes it superior to Agent 1's outdated 2024-based answer and Agent 3's more concise but less detailed poll summary.\n\n**Vote for Agent 1**: Agent 1\u2019s response is the only one grounded in a verifiable source (the April 2024 Athletic poll) rather than fabricated future data. It provides balanced \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018counterpoint\u2019 arguments, clearly explains the subjectivity of \u201coverrated,\u201d and covers both current and all-time candidates in a trustworthy, structured way.\n<END OF OTHERS' VOTES>\n"

    "content": "The label \u201cmost overrated\u201d in the NBA is inherently subjective\u2014rooted more in perception, hype, salary expectations or media narratives than in pure on-court talent.  What follows is a primer on the players most often named \u201coverrated\u201d by their peers, media and fans, with an emphasis on the best-documented anonymous NBA player poll from April 2024 as well as widely reported fan/analyst discussions.  I\u2019ve cited multiple independent sources for each key point.  \n\n1. Why \u201cOverrated\u201d Is a Moving Target  \n   \u2022 It usually reflects a gap between  \n     \u2013 Contract size or All-Star/media hype (\u201cmaxed-out\u201d salaries)  \n     \u2013 Public narrative (top-10 player buzz)  \n     \u2013 Actual impact on winning (playoff success, complementary fit)  \n   \u2022 A player can be \u201coverrated\u201d in one era and \u201cunderrated\u201d in the next\u2014Tyrese Haliburton is a recent poster child for that swing ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/13/tyrese-haliburton-indiana-pacers-nba-finals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  \n\n2. The Athletic\u2019s April 2024 Anonymous Player Poll  \n   On April 22, 2024, The Athletic surveyed 81 NBA players (more than one-third of the league) on categories including the \u201cmost overrated\u201d player.  Top vote-getters:  \n   \u2022 Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves, 13.6 percent)  \n     \u2013 13.6 percent of peers named Gobert as the league\u2019s most overrated player ([kslsports.com](https://kslsports.com/sports/rudy-gobert-john-collins-ranked-among-nba-most-overrated/515669?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) [lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n     \u2013 Criticism: Dominant defender with four DPOY nods, yet viewed as a liability in small-ball playoffs and limited offensively.  \n     \u2013 Counterpoint: Anchored the league\u2019s top defense and has repeatedly shown he can carry teams to deep playoff runs.  \n   \u2022 Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards, 8.6 percent)  \n     \u2013 8.6 percent of players pegged Poole as overrated ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n     \u2013 Criticism: Signed a four-year, $128 million extension, then posted inefficient shooting splits and erratic shot selection in 2023-24.  \n     \u2013 Counterpoint: Key \u201cmicrowave\u201d scorer in Golden State\u2019s 2022 title run, still only 25 and capable of breakout improvements.  \n   \u2022 Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks, 7.4 percent)  \n     \u2013 7.4 percent of peers called Young overrated ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n     \u2013 Criticism: Incredible playmaker/scorer but a major defensive liability, and his ball-dominant style hasn\u2019t translated to sustained playoff success since 2021.  \n     \u2013 Counterpoint: A three-time All-Star who nearly carried an underdog Hawks squad to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals.  \n\n3. Other Frequent \u201cOverrated\u201d Mentions  \n   \u2022 Dillon Brooks / James Harden (each 4.9 percent in the same poll) ([lastwordonsports.com](https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/2024/04/22/nba-players-name-choices-for-most-overrated-underrated-players/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n   \u2022 Fan/analyst lists also cite players like John Collins, Bradley Beal, Tyrese Haliburton, Julius Randle and Karl-Anthony Towns (each in the 3\u20134 percent range) ([kslsports.com](https://kslsports.com/sports/rudy-gobert-john-collins-ranked-among-nba-most-overrated/515669?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  \n\n4. \u201cHonorable Mentions\u201d from Fans & Media  \n   \u2013 Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors): Hype as a defensive leader overshadowed by on-court suspensions and diminishing stats.  \n   \u2013 Paul George (Philadelphia 76ers): All-Star reputation persists, but critics point to uneven playoff performances.  \n   \u2013 Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings): Triple-double machine whose counting stats have not yet equated to deep postseason success.  \n\n5. All-Time \u201cOverrated\u201d Candidates  \n   When you stretch the debate historically, names often resurfacing include:  \n   \u2022 Carmelo Anthony \u2013 Legendary scorer whose teams seldom advanced past Round 1 despite his prolific individual output.  \n   \u2022 Russell Westbrook \u2013 Former MVP whose triple-double records are historic but whose inefficiency and poor fit in secondary roles have drawn criticism.  \n   \u2022 Allen Iverson \u2013 MVP and cultural icon, yet his low efficiency and single Finals appearance (2001) fuel \u201coverrated\u201d arguments.  \n\nKey takeaway: \u201cMost overrated\u201d is a snapshot of perception more than a definitive basketball r\u00e9sum\u00e9.  Polls like The Athletic\u2019s (April 22, 2024) give the closest thing to an \u201cinside\u201d league consensus\u2014but even that changes year by year as players develop, contracts reset and playoff narratives evolve."

I\u2019ve included the key criticisms and counterpoints for each name.\n\n1. Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2013 13.6 percent  \n   \u2022 Why peers say he\u2019s \u201coverrated\u201d: despite three Defensive Player of the Year awards, many players view his offense as a liability and believe small-lineup playoff matchups neutralize his impact.

([people.com](https://people.com/rudy-gobert-girlfriend-julia-bonilla-defends-amid-nba-criticism-8637448?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n\n2.

Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2013 7.4 percent  \n   \u2022 Why peers say he\u2019s \u201coverrated\u201d: stellar scorer and passer, but his defense is frequently exposed, and his ball-dominant style hasn\u2019t produced deep playoff runs since 2021. ([bleacherreport.com](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117968-gobert-jordan-poole-trae-young-dillon-brooks-voted-most-overrated-by-nba-players?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n   \u2022 Counterpoint: Young has averaged over 28 points and 9 assists in each of the past three seasons, and nearly carried an underdog Hawks squad to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals.  \n\nHonorable Mentions (4.9 percent each)  \n\u2022 Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets) \u2013 lauded for toughness, but disparaged for inefficiency and on-court temperament.  \n\u2022 James Harden (Los Angeles Clippers) \u2013 future Hall of Famer, yet widely seen as underperforming his max-level contracts in recent playoffs. ([bleacherreport.com](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10117968-gobert-jordan-poole-trae-young-dillon-brooks-voted-most-overrated-by-nba-players?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n\nWhy no definitive \u201cmost\u201d overrated?  \n\u2022 \u201cOverrated\u201d boils down to a perceived gap between a player\u2019s salary/media hype and how much teammates/opponents feel he impacts winning.  \n\u2022 As contracts, roles and playstyles shift every season, so will these rankings; Gobert landed atop the list in April 2024, but it could easily be someone else after the next playoffs.  \n\nAll\u2010Time Context  \n\u2022 In broader fan/analyst debates, names like Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook or Allen Iverson surface\u2014great talents whose efficiency or team-success track records leave some feeling their reputations outpaced results.  \n\nKey takeaway: the single most \u201coverrated\u201d player is always a snapshot of whispers in locker rooms more than a definitive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 hole. For now, Rudy Gobert, Jordan Poole and Trae Young lead the pack\u2014backed by a poll of their actual peers."

Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves) \u2013 13.6% of votes  \n   \u2022 Why \u201coverrated\u201d? Despite four Defensive Player of the Year awards, many peers feel Gobert\u2019s offense is limited and that modern small-ball playoff lineups neutralize his impact.  \n   \u2022 Counterpoint: He anchored Minnesota\u2019s league-best defense in 2023-24, averaged 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game, and helped carry the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals .  \n\n2. Jordan Poole (Washington Wizards) \u2013 8.6% of votes  \n   \u2022 Why \u201coverrated\u201d? After signing a four-year, $128 million extension, Poole regressed to sub-37% shooting and erratic shot-selection in 2023-24, leading teammates to question whether his contract matched his production.  \n   \u2022 Counterpoint: At 25, he remains one of the league\u2019s most explosive bench scorers and was a key \u201cmicrowave\u201d spark on Golden State\u2019s 2022 championship team .  \n\n3. Trae Young (Atlanta Hawks) \u2013 7.4% of votes  \n   \u2022 Why \u201coverrated\u201d? His high-usage scoring and elite playmaking haven\u2019t translated into deep playoff runs since 2021, and his defensive lapses are a constant critique.  \n   \u2022 Counterpoint: Young has averaged over 28 points and 9 assists per game the last three seasons and carried the Hawks to the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals .  \n\nHonorable Mentions (4.9% each):  \n\u2022 Dillon Brooks (Houston Rockets) \u2013 Toughness praised, but inefficiency and on-court temperament draw criticism.  \n\u2022 James Harden (Los Angeles Clippers) \u2013 Future Hall-of-Famer whose recent playoff performances have felt below his max-contract billing .  \n\nKey Takeaway  \n\u201cMost overrated\u201d reflects a gap between salary/media hype and perceived on-court impact, as judged by peers, opponents and analysts. These rankings will evolve as new contracts are signed, roles shift and playoff narratives unfold\u2014so while Rudy Gobert, Jordan Poole and Trae Young topped the April 2024 poll, different names may lead after the next season or postseason."
