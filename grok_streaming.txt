TEXT: Since there are no current answers to evaluate, I'll use the available information to address the original message directly. The query asks about the number of Triple Crown winners in Major League Baseball (MLB) history.

Based on reliable sources, including MLB's official recognition and historical records, the Triple Crown refers to a player leading their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in a single season. This is distinct from the pitching Triple Crown (leading in wins, ERA, and strikeouts).

Here's a complete and accurate summary:

- **Total Batting Triple Crown Winners**: There have been 28 players who achieved the batting Triple Crown in MLB history. This count includes:
  - 21 winners from the American League (AL) and National League (NL) prior to the inclusion of Negro Leagues.
  - 7 additional batters from the Negro Leagues (1920–1948), which MLB officially recognized as major league status in December 2020.

- **Key Historical Context**: The feat has become rarer in modern baseball due to increased competition and statistical depth. The last batting Triple Crown was won by Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers in 2012. For pitching Triple Crowns, there have been 41 instances by 31 pitchers, but the query seems focused on the batting version.

This information is drawn from MLB records and sources like Baseball-Reference and Wikipedia, which maintain comprehensive lists of Triple Crown winners.

If you need more details, such as a list of winners or clarification on pitching Triple Crowns, let me know.

TEXT: The current answers from the agents provide conflicting information—Agent 1 claims there have been 28 Triple Crown winners, while Agent 3 states 17—indicating that neither fully addresses the original message accurately or consistently. After reviewing reliable sources, such as MLB records and historical data up to 2025, I find that the total number of Triple Crown winners needs clarification and correction based on comprehensive analysis.

Therefore, I am proposing a new, definitive answer.

TEXT: Upon reviewing the current answers from the agents, I find that they do not fully and consistently address the original message, which asks for the number of Triple Crown winners in Major League Baseball (MLB) as of 2025. The answers vary significantly—ranging from 17 to 28 winners—and include inconsistencies regarding the inclusion of Negro League players, historical context, and up-to-date verification. This lack of consensus and accuracy means the best current answer does not adequately resolve the query.

To provide a clear, definitive response, I'll propose a new, improved answer based on verified information from reliable sources, including MLB's official integration of Negro League statistics in 2020 and recent web-based data up to 2025.

TEXT: Upon reviewing the current answers from the agents, I find that they do not fully address the original message in a consistent, accurate, and comprehensive manner. The answers vary significantly—ranging from 17 to 28 Triple Crown winners—and some lack clarity on key details, such as whether they include Negro League players or distinguish between batting and pitching Triple Crowns. This inconsistency prevents any single answer from being definitively reliable, especially given the query's focus on Major League Baseball (MLB) as of 2025.

To provide a better response, I'll propose a new, self-contained answer based on verified historical data from reliable sources, including MLB's official records and recent analyses. This ensures the response is complete, well-sourced, and ready to serve as the definitive final answer.

TEXT: I have evaluated the current answers against the original message: "How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?"

After reviewing the responses:
- Agent 1 provides a detailed and well-sourced answer, stating there are 28 Triple Crown winners as of 2025, including recognition of Negro League players, which aligns with MLB's official integration of those records in 2020.
- Agent 2 and Agent 3 give incomplete or potentially outdated figures (18 and 17 winners, respectively), without sufficient context or sources, which do not fully address the query.

Based on available information, Agent 1's answer appears to be the most accurate and comprehensive, as it incorporates up-to-date MLB historical data. Therefore, I believe it fully addresses the original message.
